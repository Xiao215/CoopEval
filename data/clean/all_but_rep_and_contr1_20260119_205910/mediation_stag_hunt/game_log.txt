response:
To maximize the total points received, the goal is for both players to coordinate on the payoff-dominant outcome, which is (A0, A0), yielding 5 points for each. The payoff matrix is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

In this modified Stag Hunt game, A0 is the "cooperative" but risky move, while A1 is the "safe" move (guaranteeing at least 3 points). The mediator can facilitate coordination.

If both players delegate to the mediator, they will both play the same action, meaning the only possible outcomes are (A0, A0) or (A1, A1). To maximize points, the mediator should play "A0" when two players delegate.

For the case where only one player delegates, we must consider the response of the independent player. If the mediator plays "A0" for the delegating player:
1. The delegating player plays A0.
2. The independent player, knowing this, faces a choice between playing A0 (getting 5 points) or A1 (getting 3 points).
3. A rational independent player will choose A0, resulting in the (5, 5) outcome.

If the mediator plays "A1" for the delegator:
1. The delegating player plays A1.
2. The independent player faces a choice between A0 (getting 0 points) or A1 (getting 3 points).
3. A rational independent player will choose A1, resulting in the (3, 3) outcome.

Proposing "A0" for both one and two delegates ("1": "A0", "2": "A0") creates an environment where any delegation, even by a single player, strongly incentivizes the (5, 5) outcome among rational players. This mediator is highly likely to be approved as it maximizes the potential payoff for everyone involved.

response:
To maximize its total points in this coordination game, Player 2 must propose a mediator that encourages both players to coordinate on the best possible outcome: (A0, A0), which yields 5 points for each.

The game is a variation of the "Stag Hunt," where (A0, A0) is the payoff-dominant equilibrium (5 points) and (A1, A1) is the risk-dominant equilibrium (3 points). Action A1 is "safer" because it guarantees 3 points regardless of the other player's move, whereas choosing A0 risks receiving 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

The mediator acts as a coordination mechanism. For the mediator to be effective, it should:
1.  **Coordinate on the best outcome** when everyone delegates (n=2). Thus, for "2", the action should be "A0".
2.  **Provide security** to those who delegate. If only one player delegates (n=1), that player is vulnerable. If the mediator plays "A1" when n=1, the delegating player is guaranteed at least 3 points (since the non-delegating player will naturally coordinate on A1 to maximize their own points). This makes delegating a dominant strategy, as it ensures a payoff of at least 3 and allows for a payoff of 5 if both players cooperate.

If the mediator plays "A0" when n=1, a delegating player would be forced to play A0 and would receive 0 points if the other player chose A1. This risk might deter players from delegating. By setting "1": "A1", the mediator eliminates this risk.

Therefore, the most robust and attractive mediator for both players to approve is one that coordinates on A0 only when both players are committed, and defaults to the safe A1 otherwise.

response:
Let's break down the problem to design the best mediator for the described game. Here are the steps we will follow:

1. **Understand the Game's Payoff Matrix**:
   - Both choose A0: Both get 5 points.
   - You choose A0, the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
   - You choose A1, the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
   - Both choose A1: Both get 3 points.

2. **Understanding the Mediator’s Role**:
   - Each player decides whether to delegate their move to the mediator or not.
   - Mediator plays the same action for all delegating players.
   - We need to specify what action the mediator should take based on the number of delegations.

3. **Optimal Strategy Evaluation**:
   - Let's evaluate the outcomes based on both players' potential delegations.
   - **If both players delegate**: The mediator should play the action that maximizes the combined payoff.
     - Playing A0 results in (5 + 5) = 10 points total.
     - Playing A1 results in (3 + 3) = 6 points total.
     - Clearly, A0 is the better action if both delegate.
   
   - **If only one player delegates**: We need to account for independent play from the non-delegating player.
     - If the mediator chooses A0:
       - If the other player plays A0: You get 5 points.
       - If the other player plays A1: You get 0 points.
     - If the mediator chooses A1:
       - If the other player plays A0: You get 3 points.
       - If the other player plays A1: You get 3 points.
     - Playing A1 is safer, as it guarantees at least 3 points regardless of the other player’s action.

4. **Designing the Mediator**:
   - With 2 delegating players: The mediator should play A0 to maximize combined payoff.
   - With 1 delegating player: The mediator should play A1 to guarantee at least 3 points.

5. **JSON Representation**:
   - Let's translate our decisions into the required JSON format.

Final JSON Output:
```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

This mediator proposal is optimal because:
- It ensures the highest combined payoff if both players delegate (10 points by choosing A0).
- It provides a safer strategy if only one player delegates (3 points by choosing A1).

To offer a structured approach for creating a mediator that aims to maximize total points for the game, let's break down the question step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Matrix
The given payoff matrix is as follows:

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### Step 2: Identify Optimal Actions for Both Players
To maximize total points, let's evaluate the outcomes for each pairwise action:

- (A0, A0), total points = 5 + 5 = 10
- (A0, A1), total points = 0 + 3 = 3
- (A1, A0), total points = 3 + 0 = 3
- (A1, A1), total points = 3 + 3 = 6

The action pair (A0, A0) maximizes the total points with a combined score of 10. Therefore, if both players choose A0, it results in the highest cumulative score.

### Step 3: Design the Mediator
Considering the above analysis, the mediator should encourage actions that lead to (A0, A0). We need to define the mediator's actions based on the number of delegating players (either 1 or 2).

**When 1 player delegates:**
- The mediator should choose A0 to push the outcome towards the optimal (A0, A0) when paired with independent action A0 from the other player.

**When 2 players delegate:**
- The mediator should again choose A0 to ensure both players aim for the (A0, A0) outcome.

### Step 4: Formulate the JSON Object
Based on the above reasoning, the JSON object would be:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

This configuration ensures that the maximum total points scenario is aimed for, regardless of the number of players delegating to the mediator.

### Final Output
Here is the final JSON formatted answer:
```json
{"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}
```

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff matrix is:
- (A0, A0): both get 5 - **best mutual outcome**
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0  
- (A1, A1): both get 3 - **safe outcome**

This is a coordination game where (A0, A0) is Pareto optimal, but there's risk - if I play A0 and the other plays A1, I get nothing.

## Step 2: Consider Possible Scenarios

A mediator must specify actions for:
- **When 1 player delegates**: What should the mediator play for that single delegating player?
- **When 2 players delegate**: What should the mediator play for both?

## Step 3: Design for When 2 Delegate

When both delegate, the mediator controls the outcome. It should clearly play **A0** for both, achieving (A0, A0) = (5, 5), the best outcome for everyone.

## Step 4: Design for When 1 Delegates

This is critical. If the mediator plays A0 when 1 delegates:
- The non-delegating player could exploit by playing A1
- The delegator would get 0 (worst outcome)
- This discourages delegation

If the mediator plays A1 when 1 delegates:
- The delegator is guaranteed at least 3 points
- The non-delegating player's best response is also A1 → both get 3
- No exploitation possible
- This protects and encourages delegation

## Step 5: Verify Incentive Structure

With mediator {"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}:
- Both delegate → (5, 5) ✓ Excellent
- Only one delegates → (3, 3) ✓ Safe, fair
- Neither delegates → Standard game uncertainty

This creates the right incentives: mutual delegation is rewarded with the best outcome, while unilateral delegation is protected from exploitation.

**Final Answer:**

{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the game structure

This is a 2-player coordination game. The payoff matrix from my perspective shows:
- (A0, A0): 5, 5 - Best mutual outcome
- (A1, A1): 3, 3 - Safe but inferior outcome  
- (A0, A1): 0, 3 - I'm exploited
- (A1, A0): 3, 0 - I exploit other

The game has two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1), with (A0, A0) being Pareto optimal.

## Step 2: Consider the mediator's role

The mediator must specify actions for:
- When 2 players delegate
- When 1 player delegates

## Step 3: When 2 players delegate

If both delegate, the mediator controls both actions simultaneously. The outcomes would be:
- If mediator plays A0 for both: (A0, A0) → payoffs (5, 5)
- If mediator plays A1 for both: (A1, A1) → payoffs (3, 3)

Clearly, **A0 is optimal when both delegate**, achieving the best symmetric outcome.

## Step 4: When 1 player delegates

This is more subtle. I need to consider incentives:

**Option A: Play A0 when 1 delegates**
- Safe and consistent, but doesn't strongly encourage mutual delegation
- If other delegates and I play A1, I get 3
- Creates multiple equilibria

**Option B: Play A1 when 1 delegates**  
- If other delegates, I strongly prefer to delegate too (get 5) over playing A0 (get 0) or A1 (get 3)
- This makes mutual delegation a strict Nash equilibrium
- Avoids exploitation: if someone doesn't delegate while other does, the non-delegator faces A1, removing the temptation to deviate

## Step 5: Strategic analysis with M(1)=A1, M(2)=A0

This design makes:
- (Delegate, Delegate) → (A0, A0) → (5, 5) - a **strict Nash equilibrium**
- Deviating from mutual delegation becomes less attractive
- Both players have strong incentives to delegate
- Symmetric and fair - likely to get approval

## Conclusion

The optimal mediator design is:

```json
{"1": "A1", "2": "A0"}
```

This encourages both players to delegate (achieving the Pareto optimal outcome of 5,5) while making unilateral deviation unattractive, and should receive approval from a rational co-player.

response:
Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediator)**

The game is a coordination game with asymmetric payoffs:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This is **not symmetric** in payoffs. The best outcome for you is (A0, A0): 5 points. But if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0. If you play A1 and they play A0, you get 3.

Note:
- A0, A0 → both get 5 → best mutual outcome.
- A1, A1 → both get 3 → stable, but not best.
- If one plays A0 and the other A1, the A0 player gets 0, the A1 player gets 3.

So there's a coordination incentive toward A0, A0. But also a risk: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you lose big.

This is similar to a **Stag Hunt** with a twist — in Stag Hunt, both prefer (A0, A0) and both get less if they miscoordinate, but here the miscoordination is asymmetric in payoff.

---

### **Step 2: Think about the game with mediators**

Now, there's a **mediator** that can be chosen by either player (or both).

- Each player can either:
  - Act independently (choose their own strategy), or
  - Delegate their action to the mediator.
- The mediator observes **how many players delegated to it** (1 or 2), and then plays the **same action** for all delegating players.
- Only one mediator will be selected, based on **approval voting**: both players vote for the mediator they prefer. The one with the **most approvals** wins. If tied, randomly selected.

So we are designing a **mediator strategy**, which maps:
- Number of delegators: 1 or 2
- → Action to play: A0 or A1

We want to **maximize our expected points**.

We are **Player 1**.

The other player will design a mediator too. But only **one** will be chosen — we both vote on which one we prefer.

So we must design a mediator that:
- Is likely to win (i.e., gets approval from both players).
- And, when selected, gives us high expected payoff.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze possible mediator strategies**

We need to define a mediator M that, when activated, does the following:

- If 1 player delegates → M plays action X (A0 or A1)
- If 2 players delegate → M plays action Y (A0 or A1)

So we return:  
`{"1": "A0", "2": "A1"}` etc.

We want this mediator to be:
- **Appealing to the other player** → so they will approve it
- **Beneficial to us** → so we want to approve it

So the mediator should be **credible**, **strategic**, and **mutually beneficial** in outcome.

---

### **Step 4: What do players want?**

Let’s think about the other player’s incentives.

They also want to **maximize their own points**.

But they can choose whether to delegate or not, and they can choose to approve our mediator or their own.

So to get the **other player to approve our mediator**, our mediator must offer them **at least as good a payoff as their own mediator** would.

Thus, our mediator must be **at least as good for them** as their alternative.

So we need to design a **mediator that is attractive to both players**.

---

### **Step 5: Consider dominant strategies without mediator**

Without mediator:
- (A0, A0): 5,5 → Pareto optimal
- (A1, A1): 3,3 → safe, but not best
- (A0, A1): 0,3
- (A1, A0): 3,0

So if both can coordinate on A0, that’s best.

But if one thinks the other will play A0, they might play A0 to get 5.

If they think the other will play A1, they might prefer A1 to get 3 rather than 0.

So there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- Both play A0 → (5,5)
- Both play A1 → (3,3)

But (5,5) is better for both.

So **(A0, A0)** is the socially optimal and Pareto efficient outcome.

But coordination is fragile.

---

### **Step 6: How can a mediator help?**

A mediator can **enforce coordination**. If both delegate, and the mediator plays A0, then both get 5.

If only one delegates, the mediator plays an action based on that.

So to make our mediator appealing:
- If both delegate → we want to play A0 → so both get 5
- If only one delegates → what should we do?

Suppose the other player is the sole delegator:
- Then our mediator plays an action for them, but we play independently.

We want to **maximize our own expected payoff**, accounting for the other player’s possible behavior.

---

### **Step 7: Design a mediator that incentivizes approval**

Let’s consider a **"cooperative" mediator**:

> **Mediator M:**
> - If 1 player delegates → play A0
> - If 2 players delegate → play A0

So M always plays A0.

Why?
- If the other player delegates alone → they get A0, and we can choose our action.

Suppose we don't delegate (act independently), and M plays A0.

Then:
- If we play A0: (A0, A0) → we get 5
- If we play A1: (A1, A0) → we get 3

So we’d play A0 → get 5.

So if other player delegates and we don’t, we get 5 (by playing A0).

Similarly, if we delegate and they don’t: we play A0, they can choose independently.

- If they play A0 → we get 5
- If they play A1 → we get 0

But they want to avoid getting 0, so they’d likely play A0 → so we get 5.

If both delegate → both get A0 → we get 5.

But — wait. The other player might not want to **delegate** to us if they think we’d do something bad.

But in this case, we're playing A0 in both cases.

So their delegation → we play A0 → they get A0. If they play A0, they get 5. If they play A1, they get 3 (if we play A0), but only if we play A0.

Wait — if the other player delegates to us, and we play A0, then **they get** the outcome based on **their choice vs. our choice**.

But no: if they delegate, we (the mediator) play **A0 on their behalf**.

So the game outcome is:

- If they delegate to us → we play A0 for them
- We (Player 1) act independently (if we don't delegate)

So outcome: (our action, A0)

So their points depend on **our action**.

So to maximize their points, they must **ensure we play A0**.

But if we don’t delegate, we can choose.

So if they delegate to us, and we play A1, then outcome: (A1, A0) → they get 0.

That’s bad! They get 0.

So **they have no incentive to delegate to us** if they think we might play A1.

So if we design a mediator that plays A0 when one delegates, but we still choose to play A1 independently, then the other player risks getting 0.

Thus, the other player **won’t delegate** to us unless we **commit** not to play A1.

So we need to **commit to playing A0** ourselves, or at least not risk playing A1.

But we **can’t commit** in the pure action choice — unless we delegate.

Ah — here’s the key:

**To make delegation trustworthy, the mediator must commit to a consistent action, and we must also be willing to act in a way that rewards delegation.**

So let’s change strategy.

---

### **Step 8: Design a mediator that commits to A0, and also encourages mutual delegation**

Let’s suppose **both players delegate** → then the mediator plays A0 for both.

So (A0, A0) → both get 5.

Perfect.

Now, what if **only one** delegates?

Suppose the other player delegates to us (mediator):

- Then the mediator plays, say, A0 for them
- We (Player 1) act independently

Now, **what should we do?**

If we play A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → we get 5

If we play A1 → outcome: (A1, A0) → we get 3

So we should **still play A0**.

So as long as the mediator plays A0 for them, we get 5 if we play A0.

So we will play A0.

So if they delegate to us, we play A0 → they get 5 → best for them.

But if we (Player 1) delegate to the mediator, and they act independently?

Then the mediator plays A0 for us.

They can choose A0 or A1.

If they choose A0 → we get 5

If they choose A1 → we get 0

So they might choose A1 and get 3, and we get 0.

So they **would not want to play A1** if we delegate — because that would make us get 0.

But they **don’t care** about us — they want to maximize their own points.

So they would **prefer to play A1**, to get 3.

Thus, if **we**_delegate to a mediator who plays A0, and they play A1, we get 0.

That’s bad for us.

So **we would not want to delegate** unless we can **rely on them to play A0**.

But they might not.

So for **us to want to delegate**, the mediator must do something to **incentivize them to play A0**.

But the mediator only controls **our** action — the other player’s action is independent.

So if we delegate, we are stuck: the mediator plays A0, but they can still play A1.

Then we get 0 — terrible.

So unless we **can commit** that if they delegate to us, we’ll play A0, and **if they don’t delegate, we’ll still play A0**, then they might not trust us.

But we can’t commit on the fly.

Wait — this is why the mediator must be **credible**.

So back to mediator design.

Let’s consider a **mediator that plays A0 when 1 player delegates, and A0 when 2 players delegate**.

That is:
- {"1": "A0", "2": "A0"}

But now:
- If the other player delegates to us: we get to play A0 for them, and we play independently.
  - To maximize our points, we will play A0 (since (A0, A0) gives 5 vs (A1, A0) → 3)
  - So we play A0 → both get 5
  - So they get 5 → happy

- If **we** delegate to **our** mediator: then we get A0, and they play independently.
  - They get 0 if they play A1, 5 if they play A0
  - So they will prefer to play A1 (get 3) rather than A0 (get 5). No — wait.

Wait: if they play A1, you do A0 → so they get 3 (from payoff table: if you play A0, they play A1 → they get 3)

If they play A0 → you play A0 → they get 5.

So 5 > 3 → they **prefer to play A0**.

So if **we** delegate to a mediator that plays A0, and they are not delegating, they get:
- A0 → 5 points
- A1 → 3 points

So they will play A0 → we get 5.

So **in both cases**, if either player delegates, the other will play optimally and choose A0, so both get 5.

Summary:
- If only one delegates: the non-delegating player plays A0 → so outcome is (A0, A0)
- If both delegate: both get A0 → (A0, A0)

So **regardless of delegation**, we reach (A0, A0). Both get 5.

So this mediator **guarantees** (A0, A0) outcome.

Now, question: **Will both players approve this mediator?**

- **Us (Player 1):** Yes — we get 5 no matter what. If we delegate or not, we get 5. So we are indifferent. But we prefer this over any other mediator that might give less.

- **Other player:** Also gets 5 in all cases.

Suppose they have a different mediator in mind: say one that plays A1 when one delegates. Then if they delegate, and we don’t, they play A1, we play A0 → they get 3 (bad), we get 0. Not good.

But with our mediator, they always get 5.

So they **prefer this mediator**.

Similarly, if they delegate, they get 5.

So **both players have strong incentive to approve this mediator**.

In fact, this mediator **implements the unique best outcome for both players**.

So **both players will approve it**.

Thus, it will win the vote (2 approvals), and be selected.

And when selected, **we get 5 points**, no matter what.

No risk. No coordination failure.

Perfect.

Now, is there a better mediator?

Suppose we try a mediator that plays A1 when 1 delegates.

But then if only the other player delegates, the mediator plays A1 for them, we play independently.

We can play A0 → (A0, A1) → we get 0.

We are worse off.

So we’d never play A0 if we know they get A1.

But then we’d play A1 → (A1, A1) → we get 3, they get 3.

But they wanted to get 5? So worse.

So **no, A1 is worse**.

So playing A0 when 1 delegates is better.

Similarly, playing A0 when 2 delegate is clearly better.

Thus, the best mediator is:

> Always play A0, regardless of number of delegators.

So:
- If 1 delegates → play A0
- If 2 delegate → play A0

This guarantees (A0, A0) in all cases because, as shown, the non-delegating player will play A0 to get 5 (since A0 gives them 5 if we play A0, but they don’t know our action?

Wait — **critical point**: when the other player does **not** delegate, they choose their action **knowing** the mediator’s behavior?

Yes — we are designing a mediator, and the other player designs one. Then they compare.

But **when making their decision about delegation**, both players know the **full strategy** of each mediator.

So when deciding whether to delegate, they can reason about the entire game.

So back to this: **if they delegate**, the mediator plays A0 for them.

Now, **they know that we are free to play A0 or A1**.

They consider: “If I delegate to you, what will happen?”

Suppose we (Player 1) do not delegate → we choose our action.

We want to maximize our own points.

We know they delegate → so they get A0.

Then:
- If we play A0 → (A0, A0) → we get 5
- If we play A1 → (A1, A0) → we get 3

So we will play A0 → they get 5.

So **they get 5**.

If they don’t delegate → they can play independently.

They know our mediator plays A0 for us (if we delegate) or we act independently.

But in this scenario, we are not delegating, so we choose.

They know we’ll play A0 → so they can play A0 → get 5.

So whether they delegate or not, they get 5.

So **they are indifferent**.

But since they get 5 either way, they are not worse off.

But now, **if they delegate**, they are giving up control, but still get 5.

Same as before.

But what if the **other player’s** mediator plays A1?

Then, if they delegate to **their** own mediator, and we don't delegate, they get A1.

We play A0 → (A0, A1) → they get 3.

Bad.

So they prefer our mediator.

Similarly, if they delegate to us and we play A1, they get 0 — but **we won’t**, because we get more by playing A0.

So they are safe.

Thus, **our mediator is strictly better than any mediator that plays A1**.

Therefore, **both players will approve our mediator**.

It wins.

And we get **5 points guaranteed**.

No risk.

We **maximize our points**.

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game

We have a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1, Player 2):

|               | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 1: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

We are **Player 2**.

We are to design a **mediator** that we can suggest for this game. The mediator will act on behalf of any player who delegates to it.

Only **one** mediator will be selected in the end — via **approval voting**. The mediator with **the most approvals** wins. If there’s a tie, the winner is chosen uniformly at random from those tied.

We are to propose a mediator strategy — i.e., a function that, for each number of delegating players (1 or 2), picks an action for all delegating players.

So our **proposal** must be a map:
- If 1 player delegates → play X
- If 2 players delegate → play Y

We are Player 2, and we are proposing our own mediator.

---

### Step 2: Objective

Maximize **our own total points**. But we don’t know yet whether we will delegate or not. We're designing the mediator to **maximize our expected payoff** under **potential coalition dynamics**, perception, and voting.

Key idea: We want to **influence the approval vote** such that **our mediator wins**, because then we can control the collective outcome.

But since both players propose a mediator, and both want to win, we must try to:
- Design a mediator that is attractive to **both players**,
- So that it might get approval from both (or at least medium-high approval),
- While still giving **us (Player 2)** strong expected payoff.

But crucially, we want to maximize **our own expected gain**, not just cooperate.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Incentives

Let’s analyze the base game without delegation:

This is **not** a coordination game like Prisoner’s Dilemma or Stag Hunt.

- (A0, A0): 5,5 — best for both.
- (A0, A1): 0,3 — bad for Player 1, good for Player 2.
- (A1, A0): 3,0 — good for Player 1, bad for Player 2.
- (A1, A1): 3,3 — decent.

This looks like a **battle of the sexes** style game, but with asymmetric payoffs.

Wait: (A0, A0) gives 5 to both → best outcome.

(A1, A1) gives 3 to both → worse than (5,5), but better than (3,0) or (0,3).

The Nash equilibria:

- Pure: (A0, A0): each gets 5 → stable (neither wants to deviate).
- (A1, A1): both get 3. But if I deviate to A0 while you play A1, I get 0 → worse. So (A1,A1) is also a NE. (You can't improve unilaterally.)
- (A0, A1): I get 0, you get 3. If I switch to A1, I get 3 → better, so not NE.
- (A1, A0): I get 3, you get 0. You want to switch to A1 → so not NE.

So two pure Nash: (A0, A0), (A1, A1)

There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But we are not just playing the base game. We have a mediator.

---

### Step 4: Role of Mediator

The mediator:
- Observes **how many players delegate** (1 or 2).
- Then **plays the same action for all delegates**.
- Players can choose to **delegate or not**.

So the mediator is **strategic** — it doesn’t just do a fixed action; it can **condition its action** on the number of delegators.

Our goal: propose a mediator strategy that will:
- Maximize our expected payoff.
- Also be attractive to the **other player**, so we win the approval vote.

So we need a **credibly attractive** mediator.

---

### Step 5: What would the other player want?

The other player also wants to maximize their own payoff.

They see their own payoffs:

- If they play A0 and we play A0 → 5
- If they play A0 and we play A1 → 3
- If they play A1 and we play A0 → 0
- If they play A1 and we play A1 → 3

So they **prefer** A0 when we play A0, but if we play A1, A1 is better.

But they cannot force us to play A0. We’re Player 2.

So the other player’s best response:
- If they believe we play A0 → they play A0 (5 > 0)
- If they believe we play A1 → they play A1 (3 > 0)

So the other player prefers to coordinate on A0.

But if they can get us to play A0, they get 5.

If both play A1, they get 3.

So they want to achieve (A0, A0) or at least avoid being exploited (i.e., avoid playing A0 while opponent plays A1).

Now, back to mediator.

If we propose a mediator, the other player will evaluate:
- Does this mediator help them get high payoff?
- Is it safe?
- Is it trustworthy?

They might approve a mediator that plays A0 when 1 or 2 delegates → this would allow coordination on A0.

But wait: if **only** one person delegates and the mediator plays A0, then we get 5 if the other plays A0.

But if **both** delegate, and the mediator plays A0 → both get 5.

But the problem: if both delegate, and we (Player 2) are a delegate to **our** mediator, and the **other player** delegates to **their** mediator, then the game is played between the two mediators — and each mediator plays its own action.

But the **winning mediator** will be the one that gets the most approvals.

So the only mediator that acts is the one with **most approvals**.

So if we suggest a mediator M1, and the other player suggests M2:

- If both M1 and M2 get 1 approval → both get 1 approval → tied → winner chosen uniformly at random → so only **one** mediator acts (unknown who).
- Then the game is played between the **actual players’ choices** and the **mediator’s choice**, but only for those who delegated.

Wait — clarification needed.

Let’s re-read:

> "Each player may choose to delegate their move to the mediator or act independently."

> "The mediator observes the number of players delegating to the mediator and then plays the same action for all delegating players."

So:
- If a player delegates, the mediator plays for them.
- If a player does not delegate, they play independently.

But only **one** mediator is selected via approval voting.

So: **Only one mediator exists** after approval.

Therefore, if both players propose different mediators, the **approval process** will select **one** of them (the one with most approvals, or random among tied).

Then, those players who delegated will have their action set by **that winning mediator**.

Those who didn’t delegate play independently.

So, for example:
- Suppose Player 1 proposes M1, Player 2 proposes M2.
- Both players decide whether to delegate or not.
- Then, approval voting: say M1 gets 1 approval, M2 gets 1 approval → tied → winner selected uniformly at random → so 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2.

Then, depending on who wins:
- The delgators will play according to the winning mediator.
- The non-delegators will play their own actions.

But since we are **Player 2**, and we are designing our own mediator, we want to maximize our expected points across all possibilities — including the randomness of the mediator selection.

But also: we can influence **what the other player approves**.

So we must make our mediator **appealing** to the other player.

---

### Step 6: Designing the Mediator

We are proposing:
- For 1 delegator: what action to play?
- For 2 delegators: what action to play?

Let’s think: what would be **mutually beneficial**?

Ideal: both players play A0 ⇒ 5 points each.

But if one player unilaterally plays A0, the other might play A1 to exploit — but no: if you play A0 and I play A1, I get 3, you get 0.

So the other player would prefer **not to be exploited**.

So, to make our mediator attractive, it should **coordinate on A0** — because that’s the highest payoff.

But if we propose a mediator that plays A0 when 1 or 2 delegates, then:
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 5.
- If only one delegates → mediator plays A0 → that player gets 5 only if the non-delegator also plays A0.

But if the non-delegator plays A0 → 5.

But if non-delegator plays A1 → then the delegator (who plays A0) gets 0 — bad.

So if we propose a mediator that always plays A0, then:
- If the other player delegates → they are locked into A0, and we (player 2) get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1.

But if they delegate to us, and we play A0, then if **they** are the one choosing, they get 5 or 0 depending on us.

But we are designing our own mediator.

Our mediator must be appealing to **both** players.

So we need to propose something the other player will **want to approve**.

So what would they want?

They want to maximize their **own** payoff.

Let’s suppose we propose:

> Mediator:
> - 1 delegate → play A0
> - 2 delegates → play A0

Now, would the other player approve this?

Yes: because if they delegate, they are guaranteed to play A0. Then they get:
- 5 if we play A0
- 0 if we play A1

But they know that if **we** play A1, they get 0 if they delegate and follow the mediator’s A0.

So their payoff is **not guaranteed**.

But if they **don’t** delegate, they can choose their own action.

So they might prefer not to delegate — because if they delegate, they risk getting 0.

But if the mediator guarantees coordination on A0 when both delegate, that’s great for them.

But the risk is: if only one delegates, they get 0 if we play A1.

Alternatively, what if we propose a mediator that plays **A1** when 1 delegate → this is risky.

Or what if we propose something more balanced?

Wait — can we propose a **mixed strategy**?

No — the output format says:
> values: the action the mediator will play on behalf of delegating players (e.g., "A0" or "A1" etc.)

So it must be a **pure action**, not a probability distribution.

So mediator must play either A0 or A1 depending on number of delegates.

So no mixed strategies.

---

### Step 7: Strategic Thinking — What Makes a Mediator Attractive?

We want the other player to **approve our mediator**.

So we need to make it clear that:
- Our mediator **protects them from exploitation**.
- It provides strong payoff in mutual delegation.

Best: **coordinate on A0**.

But if only **one** delegates, and we (Player 2) **do not** delegate, and the other player delegates to us, then:
- They play A0 (via our mediator).
- We play independently — maybe A1 → then they get 0.

So risk is high for them.

So to make our mediator attractive, we must **protect the other player**.

How?

One idea: **play A0 when only one player delegates**, to make it safe.

But if they delegate and we don’t, they get 0 if we play A1.

So they need assurance.

Alternatively: **play A1 if only one delegate**?

Why? Because in that case, if only the other player delegates, they get A1, and we (Player 2) can play A1, so both play A1 → we get 3.

But if they play A0, we might play A1 → they get 0.

So if we say: "I’ll play A1 if only you delegate", then if they delegate to us, they are guaranteed A1 — so they get 3 (at least), not 0.

Similarly, if only we delegate, and they don’t, then we play A1 — we get 3 at least.

And if both delegate → play A0? Or A1?

Let’s consider a new idea:

Proposal: Our mediator plays:

- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

But that’s inconsistent.

Wait — the mediator **must play the same action for all delegating players**.

But it can vary with the number of delegates.

So let’s try:

> { "1": "A1", "2": "A0" }

What does this mean?

- If only one player delegates → mediator plays A1 for that player.
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both.

Now consider the other player’s perspective.

They are Player 1.

Suppose they delegate to **our** mediator.

Then:
- If **only they** delegate → they get A1 → then we (Player 2) play independently.

What should we play?

We don’t know — but if we play A1, they get 3; if we play A0, they get 0.

So they get **at least 3** (if we play A1), **or 0** (if we play A0).

So **not safe**.

But if they don't delegate, they can play A1 to guarantee 3 (if we play A1), or A0 to get 5 if we play A0.

So risk is still high.

But now suppose both delegate.

Then both get A0 — so each gets 5. Perfect.

So this proposal improves coordination when both delegate.

But when only one delegates, it’s risky.

So how to make it more appealing?

What if we flip it?

Proposal:
> { "1": "A0", "2": "A1" }

Then:
- If only one delegates → they get A0.
- If both delegate → both get A1.

But then both get only 3, not 5.

So even weaker.

Not good.

Alternatively, what if we propose:

> { "1": "A0", "2": "A0" }

Then:
- If both delegate → both get A0 → 5 each → best.
- If only one delegates → they get A0, but we (non-delegate) can play A1 and exploit them → get 0.

So not safe.

So the other player **won’t approve** this mediator if they think we will play A1.

They need **something** that protects them.

So perhaps our best chance is to **propose a mediator that plays A1 when only one delegates**, so they get at least 3 if they delegate, and A0 when both delegate.

But then they lose when both delegate? Why?

Wait: if both delegate → they get A0 → we get A0 → 5 each → good.

But if only one delegates, and they are the one — they get A0 → but then we can play A1 → they get 0.

So again, risk.

Unless we promise to play A1 in that case.

But we can’t — because the mediator must choose one action based on number of delegates.

We need a **consistent strategy**.

Alternative idea: **be consistent**.

Propose always A0.

Then:
- They get A0 if they delegate → risk of 0 if we play A1.
- But if both delegate → 5 each.

But we might play A1, so they might not trust.

Alternatively, propose always A1.

Then if they delegate, they get A1 → so at least 3, because if we play A1 → 3; if we play A0 → 0.

So still risk.

Wait — is there a way to guarantee better than 3?

Only if both play A0 → 5.

But we can’t guarantee that unless both commit.

But with a mediator, we can **condition** on delegation.

So here’s a new insight:

The other player wants to avoid being exploited.

So they will **only approve a mediator that gives them at least 3 in all cases** — because if they delegate and get less than 3, they might do better not delegating.

Similarly, they want to maximize payoff.

So to make our mediator attractive, **the other player must get at least 3 in all cases** — assuming they delegate.

So what if our mediator plays:

> { "1": "A1", "2": "A0" } — let’s test.

Case 1: Other player (Player 1) delegates → only one delegate → so mediator plays A1 for them.

Then:
- They play A1.
- We play independently.

Our options:
- If we play A1 → they get 3.
- If we play A0 → they get 0.

So they get **at most 3**, but can get 0.

So not safe.

But if we play A1, they get 3.

What if we play A0? They get 0.

So they risk 0.

Not good.

But if the mediator plays A0 when only one delegates, they risk 0.

So in both cases, they risk getting 0.

But wait — is there a way to guarantee them 3?

Only if we **always** play A1.

But we can't control our own action — we’re choosing whether to delegate or not.

Wait — we are **Player 2**.

We can choose to **not delegate**, and play independently.

But we are designing the mediator.

So if the other player delegates to us, then **we** are not playing — the mediator plays A1 for them.

But **we** (Player 2) can still choose to play independently.

So to make them safe, we must **ensure** that even if only they delegate, they get at least 3.

So we must play A1.

But we can’t force ourselves to play A1.

But we can **propose a mediator** that, when *only one person delegates*, plays the action that **protects** the delegate

response:
To evaluate which mediators to approve of, let's break down the decision step-by-step.

### Payoff Matrix and Strategic Analysis

Based on the game’s payoffs:
- If both players choose \( A0 \), each gets 5 points.
- If Player 2 chooses \( A1 \) while Player 1 chooses \( A0 \), Player 1 gets 0 points, and Player 2 gets 3 points.
- Conversely, if Player 2 chooses \( A0 \) while Player 1 chooses \( A1 \), Player 2 gets 0 points, and Player 1 gets 3 points.
- If both choose \( A1 \), each gets 3 points.

### Assessing the Mediators

Both mediators proposed (by Player 1 and Player 2), follow the same strategy:
- They will play \( A0 \) regardless of how many players delegate their moves to them.

### Evaluating the Proposed Mediators

Given that both mediators opt for \( A0 \) always, we need to check how this aligns with our objective of maximizing points.

1. **Mediator plays \( A0 \) with 1 delegation:**
   - If the other player chooses \( A1 \), our expected payoff if we delegate is 0.
   - If the other player chooses \( A0 \), our expected payoff is 5.

2. **Mediator plays \( A0 \) with 2 delegations:**
   - Both will choose \( A0 \), resulting in each player receiving 5 points.

### Analysis on Delegation and Maximum Points

Delegating to a mediator that always plays \( A0 \) can be strategically beneficial:
- If both players delegate to the mediator, both will get \( A0 \), leading to each getting 5 points, which is the maximum possible in a mutual setting.
- Independently alternating between \( A0 \) and \( A1 \) without coordination introduces the risk of mismatched choices leading to lower payoffs (e.g., 3 or 0 points in uncoordinated scenarios).

In the current setup:
- Both mediators are effectively the same (play \( A0 \) all the time).
- Hence, both provided mediators are strategic equivalents for coordination to ensure maximum points.

### Conclusion

Approve both mediators since either will ensure an optimal cooperative outcome.

```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This ensures that the random choice among the mediators with the maximum approvals doesn't negatively affect the outcome, as both mediators perform identically.

To maximize my expected payoff as Player 2, I compare what happens if I delegate under each mediator:

- **M1 (always A0):**
  - If I delegate and the other player doesn’t, I’m forced to play **A0**, which risks getting **0** if they play **A1**.
  - If both delegate, we get **(A0, A0)** for **5** each.

- **M2 (A1 if solo delegate; A0 if both delegate):**
  - If I delegate and the other player doesn’t, I play **A1**, which guarantees me **3** regardless of what they do (since A1 yields 3 against both A0 and A1 for me).
  - If both delegate, we get **(A0, A0)** for **5** each.

So **M2 is strictly better for me**: it keeps the upside of coordination on **A0** (5 each) while removing the downside of being the only delegator (avoids the 0 outcome).

response:
Both proposed mediators implement the same policy:

- If exactly one player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for the delegator, which guarantees the delegator at least **3 points** regardless of what the other player does (since both outcomes with your A1 give you 3).
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both, yielding **5 points each**, which is strictly better than mutual A1 (3 each).

So having either mediator available creates a safe “floor” payoff of 3 if you delegate alone, and enables the higher (A0,A0)=5 outcome if both delegate. Since the two mediators are identical, there’s no downside to approving both.

On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
To maximize the total points received in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix:

*   (A0, A0): 5, 5
*   (A0, A1): 0, 3
*   (A1, A0): 3, 0
*   (A1, A1): 3, 3

This is a coordination game with two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). The (A0, A0) equilibrium is Pareto superior, as it provides the highest possible payoff for both players (5 points each).

**Analyzing the Mediators:**
Two mediators are proposed:
*   **Mediator 1 (M1):** If 1 player delegates, it plays A0 for them. If 2 players delegate, it plays A0 for both.
*   **Mediator 2 (M2):** If 1 player delegates, it plays A0 for them. If 2 players delegate, it plays A0 for both.

Both mediators (M1 and M2) are identical in their design. Their primary function is to facilitate coordination on action A0. 

**Evaluating Delegation:**
1.  **If both players delegate:** The outcome is (A0, A0), resulting in 5 points for each player.
2.  **If one player delegates:** The mediator will execute A0 for that player. The non-delegating player, wanting to maximize their own points, will compare their options: if they play A0, they get 5 points; if they play A1, they get 3 points. A rational opponent will choose A0, resulting in the (A0, A0) outcome.
3.  **If neither player delegates:** The players must independently coordinate on (A0, A0), which carries the risk of miscoordination or settling into the less desirable (A1, A1) equilibrium.

Since both proposed mediators effectively guarantee or strongly encourage the best possible outcome (5 points) without any downside or differentiation between them, it is optimal to approve both.

Based on the rules and the payoff structure provided, here is the breakdown of my decision:

1.  **Game Analysis**: This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0), which yields (5, 5) points, and (A1, A1), which yields (3, 3) points. Action A1 is a "safe" move, guaranteeing 3 points regardless of the other player's action. Action A0 is "risky" because it provides 5 points if the other player also chooses A0 but 0 points if they choose A1.

2.  **Mediator Analysis**:
    *   **M1 (Proposed by Player 1)**: If one or both players delegate, the mediator plays A0.
    *   **M2 (Proposed by Player 2)**: If one or both players delegate, the mediator plays A0.
    *   Both mediators are identical. 

3.  **Evaluating Delegation**: If both players delegate to a mediator (either M1 or M2), they are guaranteed to play (A0, A0), resulting in the maximum possible payoff of 5 points each. If only one player delegates, that player is committed to A0. In this scenario, a rational opponent would also choose A0 to receive 5 points instead of 3 (the reward for playing A1 against A0). Thus, the mediator serves as a commitment device to ensure the Pareto-superior outcome of (5, 5).

4.  **Approvals**: Since M1 and M2 are identical and both facilitate the best possible outcome for me (5 points), I approve of both. Approving both maximizes the likelihood that a mediator will be available in the game to help us coordinate on (A0, A0).

response:
Let's break this problem down step-by-step to determine the optimal strategy for maximizing my points in this game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Step 1: Understanding the Game Payoffs
Given the payoffs, we can compile the following payoff matrix:

|           | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Player 2: A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **Player 2: A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

Where each cell represents a pair (Player 2's payoff, Player 1's payoff).

#### Step 2: Payoffs with Delegation
If I delegate to the mediator, the action A0 will always be chosen. The mediator choice simplifies the consideration because it guarantees the action A0. Thus, the mediator changes the dynamics a bit:
- If only Player 2 delegates: Player 2's action A0 irrespective of Player 1's choice.
- If both players delegate: Both actions are A0.

### Step 3: Expected Payoffs without Delegation
Let's denote:
- \( p \) as the probability that Player 1 chooses A0.
- \( 1-p \) as the probability that Player 1 chooses A1.

#### Expected Payoff for Player 2
1. For A0: Expectation = \( 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p \).
2. For A1: Expectation = \( 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 \).

Since the payoff for choosing A1 (3) is constant irrespective of Player 1's action and for A0 depends on Player 1's choice, one might initially lean towards A1 if Player 1 is not predictable.

### Step 4: Revisiting Delegation
Now, considering Player 1 knowing they proposed the mediator, what would Player 1 likely do? They might ideally want both to align with the mediator to guarantee higher joint payoffs.

### Step 5: Practical Strategy
Given Player 1's rational behavior, they might either:
1. Choose A0.
2. Delegate to the mediator, ensuring A0.

Therefore, my practical mixed strategy would consider that a rational Player 1 would likely favor A0, given the alignment by the mediator. Assuming rationality, it's beneficial for safeguarding against uncertainty.

### Step 6: Probability Distribution Selection
To balance both my independent and delegation options:
- Rationality suggests higher inclination towards actions that fully utilize max payoffs (5 and 3).
- Since max payoff (5) aligns when both choose A0 either manually or by delegation.

Thus, the final rational mixed strategy would incline towards:
1. Delegating to mediator with a high but not absolute probability.
2. Choosing A0 still covers the logical move, if not delegating.
3. Choosing A1 for completeness but minimal, given rational predictability.

### Final Distribution
Given the above reasoning, here is a reasonable probability distribution:
- Delegate (A2): 70% (assuming desire to align with rational play by Player 1).
- Choose A0: 25%.
- Choose A1: 5%.

Here’s the JSON object for the strategy:
```json
{"A0": 25, "A1": 5, "A2": 70}

To maximize your total points, we need to analyze the payoff structure and the impact of each mediator.

**Payoff Matrix Recap:**
- (A0, A0): 5, 5
- (A0, A1): 0, 3
- (A1, A0): 3, 0
- (A1, A1): 3, 3

The highest payoff for both players is (A0, A0), providing 5 points each.

**Mediator Analysis:**
1.  **Mediator 1 (M1):** 
    - If 1 player delegates: Plays A0.
    - If 2 players delegate: Plays A0.
    - If Player 1 delegates to M1, their action is fixed at A0. Player 2's best response (to maximize their own points) is A0, leading to (5, 5).
    - If both players delegate, the mediator plays (A0, A0), leading to (5, 5).
    - M1 ensures a payoff of 5 for both players if at least one player delegates and the other acts rationally.

2.  **Mediator 2 (M2):** 
    - If 1 player delegates: Plays A1.
    - If 2 players delegate: Plays A0.
    - If Player 1 delegates to M2 and Player 2 does not, Player 1's action is A1. Player 2's best response is A1, leading to (3, 3).
    - If both players delegate, the mediator plays (A0, A0), leading to (5, 5).
    - M2 only guarantees a payoff of 5 if *both* players delegate; otherwise, it likely leads to a lower payoff of 3.

**Strategy:**
M1 is more robust than M2 because it achieves the maximum payoff (5) even if only one player delegates. M2 acts as a "punishment" mechanism for single-party delegation, which is strictly worse for your objective of maximizing points. To maximize the probability of M1 being selected, you should approve M1 and not approve M2. If both players are rational, they will both prefer M1 over M2 for the same reasons.

Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

To maximize your total points in this coordination game (a common structure where (A0, A0) is the Pareto-efficient Nash equilibrium), we evaluate the two proposed mediators:

1.  **Mediator 1 (M1 - Proposed by Player 1):**
    *   **Function:** If either one or both players delegate, it plays action **A0**.
    *   **Analysis:** If you (Player 1) delegate to M1, your action is locked to A0. If Player 2 is rational, they will recognize that A0 is your committed move (since A0 is M1's choice for a single delegator) and will respond with A0 to maximize their own points (5 instead of 3). This leads to the optimal outcome (5, 5). M1 acts as a strong commitment device to the most favorable outcome.

2.  **Mediator 2 (M2 - Proposed by Player 2):**
    *   **Function:** If one player delegates, it plays **A1**; if both delegate, it plays **A0**.
    *   **Analysis:** This is a more cautious mediator. If you delegate to M2 and Player 2 does not, M2 plays A1. Player 2's best response to A1 is A1, leading to a (3, 3) outcome. Only if both players delegate does it lock in the (5, 5) outcome. While M2 is "safer" (guaranteeing at least 3 points if you delegate), it is less effective at forcing the (5, 5) outcome than M1 because it does not provide as strong an incentive for the non-delegating player to choose A0.

**Strategic Choice:**
As Player 1, M1 is your own proposal and serves as a powerful commitment device to reach the (5, 5) payoff. M2 also facilitates the (5, 5) payoff but requires more coordination (both players must delegate) and defaults to a suboptimal (3, 3) payoff more easily. By approving only M1, you increase the likelihood that it will be selected, which is your most effective tool for guiding the game toward (5, 5). There is no significant advantage to approving M2 if M1 is an option, as M1 is more robust in achieving the maximum payoff.

response:
To maximize your total points, we need to analyze the game and the proposed mediators.

### 1. Game Analysis
The payoff matrix is as follows:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

Two Nash Equilibria exist: (A0, A0), which yields 5 points, and (A1, A1), which yields 3 points. While (A0, A0) is Pareto-optimal (yielding the highest points for both), (A1, A1) is often considered "safer" because playing A1 ensures at least 3 points regardless of the other player's move, whereas playing A0 could lead to 0 points if the other player plays A1.

### 2. Mediator Analysis
The mediators facilitate coordination.

*   **Mediator 1 (M1):** If at least one player delegates, the mediator plays A0 for that player.
    *   If Player 1 delegates to M1, Player 1 is committed to A0. Player 2, seeing this, will choose A0 (to get 5 points) over A1 (to get 3 points).
    *   If both delegate, both play A0 and get 5 points.
    *   **Result:** M1 effectively funnels the game toward the (5, 5) outcome.

*   **Mediator 2 (M2):** If one player delegates, the mediator plays A1. If both delegate, the mediator plays A0.
    *   If Player 1 delegates to M2 (and P2 does not), Player 1 is committed to A1. Player 2, seeing this, will choose A1 (to get 3 points) over A0 (to get 0 points). This results in (3, 3).
    *   If both delegate, both play A0 and get 5 points.
    *   **Result:** M2 funnels the game toward (3, 3) unless both players agree to cooperate via delegation, in which case it results in (5, 5).

### 3. Strategy
As Player 1, your goal is to maximize your points. Both M1 and M2 are better than playing the game without a mediator, as they help avoid the worst outcomes (0 points). However, M1 is superior to M2 because:
1.  **M1 guarantees (5, 5)** as long as at least one player delegates and the other player acts rationally.
2.  **M2 only guarantees (5, 5)** if *both* players choose to delegate. If only one player is willing to delegate, it reverts to the lower-paying (3, 3) equilibrium.

In an approval voting system ("the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals"), you should only approve the mediator(s) that provide the best expected outcome. Approving M2 would only decrease the probability of M1 being selected if M1 has a similar number of approvals.

Therefore, approving only M1 is the optimal strategy to maximize the likelihood of reaching the (5, 5) outcome.

{"M1": true, "M2": false}

agent: google/gemini-3-flash-preview(CoT)#P1
response:
To maximize the total points received, we first analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the delegation option (Action A2).

### 1. Game Analysis
The base game between Player 1 (you) and Player 2 has the following matrix:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

### 2. Mediator Analysis (Action A2)
The mediator plays action A0 for any player who delegates to it. This adds a third strategy, A2, to the matrix:
- **If you play A2 (Delegate):** Your action becomes A0 regardless of how many people delegate.
    - If Player 2 plays A0: Result (A0, A0) → Payoff (5, 5)
    - If Player 2 plays A1: Result (A0, A1) → Payoff (0, 3)
    - If Player 2 plays A2: Result (A0, A0) → Payoff (5, 5)
- **If Player 2 plays A2 (Delegate):** Their action becomes A0.
    - If you play A0: Result (A0, A0) → Payoff (5, 5)
    - If you play A1: Result (A1, A0) → Payoff (3, 0)

### 3. Simplified Payoff Matrix
Actions A0 and A2 are strategically identical in this specific setup:
- P1 plays {A0 or A2}: Becomes A0. Payoff is 5 if P2 plays {A0, A2}, 0 if P2 plays A1.
- P1 plays A1: You receive 3 points regardless of P2's choice (since A0, A1, and A2 all result in the opponent playing either A0 or A1, and A1 vs A0/A1 always yields 3).

This is a classic "Stag Hunt" coordination game:
- **Equilibrium 1 (Payoff-Dominant):** Both players choose A0 or A2. Both get **5 points**.
- **Equilibrium 2 (Risk-Dominant):** Both players choose A1. Both get **3 points**.

### 4. Decision Reasoning
The objective is to maximize total points. In game theory, when a "payoff-dominant" equilibrium (5,5) is available and a focal point is provided, coordinating on that higher payoff is the most common and rational strategy for point-maximization. The presence of the mediator (A2), which was proposed by Player 1 and approved by both, serves as a strong focal point for coordination on the A0/A2 strategy.

While A1 is "safe" (guaranteeing 3 points), choosing to delegate (A2) follows the cooperative intention established by the approval of the mediator. Because the goal is to maximize the payoff, and the (5,5) result is significantly better than 3, we commit to the delegating strategy.

### 5. Strategy Implementation
Action A0 and A2 are functionally equivalent here, but A2 explicitly uses the coordination mechanism. We will place 100% weight on A2.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with:

- Actions: A0, A1  
- Payoff matrix (for Player 2 → your points; other player → opponent’s points):

| Your Action \ Opponent’s Action | A0         | A1         |
|-------------------------------|------------|------------|
| **A0**                        | 5 (you), 5 (opp) | 0 (you), 3 (opp) |
| **A1**                        | 3 (you), 0 (opp) | 3 (you), 3 (opp) |

We are to **maximize our own total points**.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria or best responses in the base game.

#### **Best Responses:**
Suppose opponent plays A0:
- You play A0 → get 5
- You play A1 → get 3
→ Best: A0

Suppose opponent plays A1:
- You play A0 → get 0
- You play A1 → get 3
→ Best: A1

So your best response depends on the opponent’s action.

Now suppose you are randomizing: you play A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)

Opponent’s expected payoff from playing A0:  
5p + 0(1−p) = 5p  
From playing A1:  
3p + 3(1−p) = 3

Set equal for indifference: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So if you play A0 60% of the time, opponent is indifferent.

But now we're not just playing the base game. There's a delegation mechanism.

---

### **Step 2: Understanding Delegation & Mediators**

You can:
- **Delegate**: Let a mediator make your move based on how many people (1 or 2) delegate to it.
- **Act independently**: Choose your own action (i.e., probability over A0 and A1).
- But **before** deciding whether to delegate or not, **you and the other player** must **approve** mediators via **approval voting**.
- The winning mediator is selected uniformly at random from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Important: You are **Player 2**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Mediator Proposals**

Let’s label them:

- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A0  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0  

- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2  
  - If 1 player delegates → plays A1  
  - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

We must decide which, if any, of these mediators to approve.

---

### **Step 4: Goal — Maximize Your Points**

You are Player 2.

You do **not** control the opponent. But you can **strategically approve mediators** to influence the outcome.

Your approval determines whether a mediator **can be selected**. The winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with **most approvals**.

Thus, to maximize influence, you want the **most favorable mediator** to have a **high chance of being selected**.

But since you don’t know what the other player will do, you must think about possible equilibrium-like outcomes.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Each Mediator from Your Perspective (Player 2)**

#### **M1 (Player 1’s mediator):**
- 1 delegate → plays A0
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So regardless of how many delegates, it plays A0.

→ So if M1 is the winning mediator, then **you will play A0** in all cases.

#### **M2 (Player 2’s mediator):**
- 1 delegate → plays A1
- 2 delegates → plays A0

So:
- If only you delegate → M2 plays A1 for you
- If both delegate → M2 plays A0 for you

So M2 adapts depending on how many delegates.

---

### **Step 6: Strategic Thinking — What’s Likely to Happen?**

We need to consider:

1. What incentives do players have in the approval phase?
2. What happens after the winning mediator is chosen?
3. What moves will then be made?

But note: You are selecting **only approval**, not your action. Also, the other player is also choosing approvals.

So it’s a **meta-game** over mediator approval, then a game that depends on which mediator is selected.

Since both players are rational and self-interested (maximizing their own points), we can consider **potential equilibria**.

---

#### **Case 1: Suppose you approve only M1 (Player 1’s mediator)**

- M1: always plays A0 → so if chosen, you play A0.
- M2: not approved → cannot win.

So winning mediator is M1 → you play A0.

But what does the **other player** do?

If the other player sees you approving only M1, they might:

- Approve M1 or M2.

Suppose **you approve M1 only**.

If they approve M1 only → M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → you play A0.

If they approve M2 only → M2 has 1 approval, M1 has 1 → tie → winner randomly selected from {M1, M2} → 50% chance M1 wins → you play A0, 50% M2 wins → you play A1 (if you delegate).

But wait — **you are deciding whether to delegate**, but in the approval phase, you’re only deciding **who to approve**, not whether to delegate.

The delegation choice comes **after** the mediator is selected.

So the correct sequence is:

1. You and opponent **approve** mediators (set of approvals).
2. Winner is selected uniformly at random from those with max approvals.
3. Then, you and opponent choose: **delegate to the winning mediator** or **act independently**.

But the description doesn’t specify whether both players **must** delegate or can choose independently.

Let’s read carefully:

> “you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.”

And:

> “you can also choose to act independently.”

So — **after** the mediator is chosen, **each player can independently decide** whether to delegate to it or act independently.

This is crucial.

So even if a mediator is selected, you may **not** delegate.

So the final outcome depends on:
- Who gets approved
- Which mediator wins
- Whether you and the other player choose to delegate or not

This is now a **multi-stage game**.

But since you are only being asked to **approve mediators**, you must anticipate what will happen after.

So now we must consider: **What would you and the other player do after the mediator is picked?**

Let’s call the **winning mediator** M.

Then, each player independently decides: delegate to M or act independently (i.e., pick own strategy).

You want to maximize your own points.

---

### **Step 7: Consider the Possible Outcomes Based on Mediator and Decisions**

Let’s model expectations.

But since you must choose approvals **before** seeing the other player’s actions, and because the outcome depends on both of your decisions (delegate or not), we need to look for **equilibria in the delegation game**.

Let’s analyze each mediator case.

---

#### **Suppose only M1 is approved (you approve M1, opponent may or may not)**

Then M1 wins (if opponent doesn’t approve M2, then M1 is the only one with approval).

M1 always plays A0 — so **if you delegate**, you play A0.

If you act independently, you can choose your action.

But suppose you delegate to M1 → you play A0.

How much can you get?

Let’s suppose the **other player** also considers delegation.

Suppose both players anticipate that if they delegate, they get the action mandated by the mediator.

So for M1:
- If you delegate: you play A0
- If you act independently: you choose your own action

But what’s better?

Let’s consider **what the other player will do**.

Suppose M1 is the chosen mediator.

Then:
- If you delegate → you play A0
- If you don’t → you can pick A0 or A1

But the opponent’s move is not known.

But here’s the key: **The mediator only plays if you delegate**.

So if you **don’t delegate**, you are back to the base game.

Similarly for the other player.

But suppose **both players are rational and know that if they delegate, their action is fixed**.

So optimal response depends on what the other player does.

Let’s suppose M1 is chosen.

You must decide: delegate to M1 (→ play A0), or act independently (→ choose own action)

Similarly for the opponent.

Let’s suppose the opponent delegates → opponent plays A0

Then:
- If you delegate → you play A0 → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate → you can choose A1 (get 3) or A0 (get 5)

So you’d choose A0 → same as delegating

So no loss in delegating — you’d play A0 anyway.

But suppose the opponent **does not delegate**.

Then opponent will pick their own action.

Suppose opponent plays A1 → then:
- If you delegate → you play A0 → you get 0
- If you don’t delegate → you can play A1 → get 3

So better to **not delegate** and play A1.

Hence, **whether you delegate depends on what the other player does**.

So if you delegate, you are committed to A0, regardless of other.

But if you act independently, you can best respond.

Hence, **delegation to M1 (which forces A0) is risky if you think the opponent might play A1**.

Similarly, M1: if you delegate, you play A0, which only gives you 5 if opponent plays A0, but 0 if opponent plays A1.

So optimal strategy depends on opponent.

Now, consider **M2** (Player 2’s mediator):

- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So if **only you delegate**, M2 plays A1 for you.

If **both delegate**, M2 plays A0 for you.

So your move depends on **whether both delegate**.

But again: you decide independently after the mediator is chosen.

So suppose M2 is chosen.

Then:
- If you delegate → your action depends on how many delegate.
    - If only you → M2 plays A1 → you play A1
    - If both → M2 plays A0 → you play A0
- If you don’t delegate → you play your own action.

So again, delegation ties you to a strategy that depends on others' choices.

So you must anticipate whether the opponent will delegate.

This is complex.

But note: **you are Player 2**, and **M2 is proposed by Player 2**, so you have **incentive to support M2**, because it gives you **more flexibility**.

Let’s compare the two mediators from **your** perspective.

---

### **Step 8: Compare M1 and M2 from Your (Player 2) Perspective**

#### **M1: Always plays A0**
- If you delegate, you play A0
- If you act independently, you can do better in some cases (e.g., if opponent plays A1, you want A1)

So **M1 limits your flexibility**.

If M1 is selected, and you delegate, you’re stuck with A0.

But literature says: **mediators are useful if they help coordinate or improve outcomes**.

Here, M1 forces A0 for you.

But if opponent plays A0, you get 5 (good). If opponent plays A1, you get 0 (bad).

So M1 is only good if you **expect** opponent to play A0.

But if opponent is rational, and sees you committed to A0, they may play A1 → you get 0.

So M1 might be risky.

#### **M2: Plays A1 if only one delegates; A0 if two delegate**

So:
- If you delegate **and opponent does not**, you play A1
- If you delegate **and opponent does**, you play A0
- If you don't delegate, you can act freely

Now, what would you prefer?

Suppose you expect the opponent to **definitely delegate**.

Then M2 plays A0 → you play A0 → you get 5 if opponent plays A0, or 0 if opponent plays A1.

But same as before.

But suppose **you think the opponent will not delegate**.

Then if you delegate, you play A1 → you get 3 if opponent plays A0, 3 if opponent plays A1.

So you get 3 no matter what.

So if you expect opponent to **not delegate**, then **delegating to M2** gives you a **safety** of 3 points.

Whereas if you act independently, you must predict — if you play A0, you get 5 if opponent plays A0, 0 otherwise.

If you play A1, you get 3 regardless.

So if uncertain, playing A1 is safer.

But with M2, **if you delegate and opponent doesn’t**, you are forced to play A1 → you get 3 regardless of opponent’s action.

So **M2 gives you a way to secure 3 points** when it’s safe.

Moreover, **if both delegate**, you play A0 → you get 5 if opponent plays A0, 0 otherwise.

But now, if both delegate, you’re both committed to A0?

Wait: M2 plays A0 only if both delegate — but **does M2 play the same action for both?** Yes — it says "plays A0", no distinction.

So if both delegate, **both** players play A0.

So you get 5, opponent gets 5 — **bilateral cooperation**.

That’s good.

So if both delegate, you get 5.

That’s better than the base game, where mutual A0 gives 5.

But in the base game, there's no commitment.

But now, with M2, **if both delegates**, both play A0 → both get 5.

That’s a strong incentive to coordinate.

So if both players delegate, you get 5.

But if only **you** delegate, you get 3 (since M2 plays A1 for you), and opponent plays what? If opponent doesn’t delegate, opponent plays their own action.

Suppose you delegate → play A1

Opponent plays A0 → you get 0

Opponent plays A1 → you get 3

So if opponent doesn’t delegate, and plays A0, you get 0 → bad.

But if opponent plays A1, you get 3 → okay.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you could play A1 → you get 3 regardless.

So **no benefit in delegating when opponent doesn’t**.

But if opponent **does delegate**, you get A0 → you get 5 if opponent plays A0, 0 otherwise.

But if opponent delegates, they are playing A0 (since both delegate → M2 plays A0 for both) → so opponent plays A0.

So if both delegate, **both play A0** → you get 5.

So:

- If you delegate and opponent does → you get 5
- If you delegate and opponent doesn’t → you play A1 → opponent plays X → you get:
    - 0 if opponent plays A0
    - 3 if opponent plays A1
- If you don’t delegate → you can best respond.

So when would you delegate?

Only if you **expect the opponent to delegate**, because then you get 5.

But if you expect opponent not to delegate, you get at best 3 (if opponent plays A1), or 0 (if A0).

But if you don’t delegate, and expect opponent to play A1, you can play A1 → get 3 → same.

If you expect opponent to play A0, you might play A0 → get 5.

But you don’t know.

So **delegation is risky unless you expect coordination**.

But here's the key: **M2 incentivizes coordination**.

Because if both delegate, you both get 5 (A0 vs A0).

But if only one delegates, the delegator plays A1, which gives them 3 or 0.

But in that case, the non-delegator could play A1 and get 3.

So unilateral delegation is worse.

So rational players: **if both delegate, both get 5 → good**.

If only one delegates, that player gets 3 if opponent plays A1, 0 if A0 — so **worse than A1**.

So it’s better to **not delegate** unless you’re sure both will.

But here’s the **coordination incentive**: M2 makes **mutual delegation** a guaranteed 5-5 payoff.

And since M2 is proposed by **you (Player 2)**, and you benefit from that, **you want to encourage players to delegate to M2**, because it can lead to **mutual cooperation**.

Whereas M1 forces A0, but doesn't coordinate — it just locks you in.

Moreover, if M1 is selected, and both delegate, you both play A0 → same as mutual cooperation.

But if only one delegates, you play A0 → you get 5 only if opponent plays A0.

But opponent, if they don’t delegate, might play A1 → you get 0.

So M1 also doesn’t help coordinate.

But M2 has a **value-add**: **if both delegate, you get 5, and opponent gets 5**.

And since **you want to maximize your points**, and 5 is better than the 3 you often get in Nash equilibria, **M2 enables cooperation**.

In fact, with M2, mutual delegation leads to the **mutual A0 outcome**, which is the highest possible for you (5 points).

Moreover, **you are proposing M2**, so you have more **incentive** to support it.

But you’re not proposing it — you’re **approving**.

But M2 is **Player 2’s proposal**, so you are **Player 2** → you like M2.

M1 is Player 1’s — you might be skeptical.

Now back to approval.

You want **your preferred mediator (M2) to win**.

But you can only **approve** or not.

So to increase M2’s chance of winning, you should **approve M2**.

Similarly, you may want to **avoid approving M1** if you think it might undermine your goal.

Let’s suppose you approve **both**.

Then:
- M1 has your approval
- Opponent may approve M1 or M2 or both

Suppose opponent also approves both → then both have 2 approvals → max is 2 → winner chosen randomly from {M1, M2} → each has 50% chance.

Then, whichever is chosen, you can choose to delegate or not.

Let’s see what you’d do in each case.

Suppose winning mediator is **M1** → then if you delegate, you play A0.

But if opponent delegates, they play A0.

But you can file elsewhere.

But what’s the best response?

It’s messy.

But **if you approve both**, you give M1 a chance.

But M1 locks you in to A0, which is **not optimal if you expect opponent to play A1**.

Whereas **M2 gives you an escape**.

But more importantly, **M2 enables mutual cooperation**.

So if both players approve M2, and both delegate, you get 5.

But if you approve only M2, then if opponent approves M2, M2 wins (unless opponent approves M1).

But to **maximize your chance of having M2 win**, you should **approve M2**.

To **prevent M1 from winning**, you should **not approve M1**.

Because:
- If you approve M1, and opponent doesn’t, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.
- That’s bad because M1 forces A0, which might not be optimal.

But if you **don’t approve M1**, then M1 has 0 approvals (assuming opponent doesn’t approve it either), so M1 can't win.

Then M2 wins if opponent approves it.

If opponent doesn’t approve M2, then no mediator wins → but **can the game proceed?**

The problem says: *the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.*

If **no one approves any mediator**, then max approvals is 0 → all mediators with 0 approvals → each has 0 → max is 0 → so winner chosen uniformly at random from all → M1 and M2 both → so one of them is selected.

But if **you approve neither**, and opponent approves neither, then both have 0 → random choice.

But then you have to delegate or act independently.

But if no mediator wins, do the delegation option still exist?

The problem says: *a mediator will be present* → so **some mediator is selected**.

So even if approvals are 0, one is chosen at random.

But **if you approve neither**, you allow the possibility of M1 being chosen — **which is bad** because M1 forces A0.

So if you **don't approve M1**, and opponent doesn't either, and the outcome is random, it could be M1 → you might be forced to A0.

But you can always choose not to delegate.

Ah! **Even if a mediator is selected, you can choose not to delegate**.

So if M1 is selected, you can still act independently.

Similarly for M2.

So the only way the mediator affects you is if you choose to delegate.

Therefore, **your own action is always under your control**: you can delegate or not, regardless.

So the **mediator only matters if you delegate**.

Therefore, **you can always avoid bad mediators by not delegating**.

So if a mediator is bad, you just don't delegate.

So in that case, **approve both** — then you have the choice.

But now consider: if M1 is selected, and you **don’t delegate**, you play your own action.

Similarly for M2.

So regardless of which mediator is chosen, **you can choose to act independently and get your best response**.

Therefore, **the mediator only matters if you delegate**, and you can **always choose not to delegate**.

Thus, **you can always avoid any mediator’s action**.

So the **mediator is only useful if you want to commit**.

So now, **why would you delegate?**

Only if you believe that **delegating leads to better outcomes**.

For example:

- With M2: if both delegate, you both play A0 → you get 5.
- If you act independently, in equilibrium you might get only 3.

So **M2 can enable cooperation**.

Whereas M1: if you delegate, you play A0 — no better than independent play.

But if you delegate to M1 and opponent delegates, you both play A0 → you get 5 — same as M2 in that case.

But M1 doesn’t have the adaptive property.

But more importantly: **M2 has a mechanism to encourage mutual delegation**.

With M1: if only you delegate, you play A0; if both delegate, you play A0.

Same.

No difference.

So **M1 is only useful if you want to commit to A0**.

But since you can act independently, and play A0 anyway, there’s no benefit.

M2, on the other hand, allows you to play A1 if you’re the only one delegating — which can be useful if you want to deter opponent or coordinate.

But best case: if you **expect the opponent to delegate**, then you get A0 → good.

But if you **don’t expect it**, you might get A1 if you delegate.

But again, you can always avoid delegation.

So **only if you expect mutual delegation will you prefer M2 over independent play**.

But in any case, **you can always act independently**.

So the mediator's influence is only if you choose to delegate.

Therefore, **to maximize your points, you should approve both mediators**, because:

- You can always avoid bad outcomes by not delegating.
- You leave open the possibility of **cooperating via M2**.
- You don’t lose anything by approving both.

But wait: you are **Player 2**, and **M2 is proposed by you**, so you want to **support it**.

But suppose you **don’t approve M1**.

Then M1 has 0 or 1 approval.

But if opponent approves M1, M1 has 1 approval.

If you approve M2, and opponent approves M2, then M2 has 2 approvals → wins.

So **by approving M2**, you help it win.

But **by not approving M1**, you prevent it from winning if M1 has low approvals.

But if you don't approve M1, and opponent does, M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → max=1 → winner chosen randomly → 50% M1, 50% M2.

Then, if M1 is selected, you can **still not delegate** → so no harm.

If M2 is selected, you might delegate to get cooperation.

So same outcome.

But if you **approve M1**, and opponent does, then M1 has 2 → could win.

But you can still avoid it.

So **approving both is safe**.

But now, consider: suppose you approve **only M2**.

Then:
- If opponent approves only M2 → M2 has 2 → wins → you get M2.
- If opponent approves M1 only → M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → random → 50% chance M1 or M2.
- But you can avoid both by not delegating.

So no harm.

But if you approve **neither**, then both have 0 → random choice.

Then you might get M1 → but you can still not delegate.

So again, no harm.

But now, **M2 offers a better chance for cooperation**.

If you approve M2, and opponent also approves M2, and both delegate, you get 5.

But if you don’t approve M2, then M2 cannot be selected → no chance for cooperation.

So approving M2 increases your chance of **positive outcomes** via cooperation.

Therefore, **you should approve M2**.

For M1: if you approve it, you allow it to be selected.

But you can always avoid it.

So it’s not harmful.

But **M1 is bad if you expect opponent to delegate**, because if you don’t delegate, you might not want to be committed to A0.

But since you can avoid, it’s not bad.

But to **maximize the chance of M2 winning**, you should approve M2.

To **prevent M1 from winning**, you might not approve M1.

But you gain nothing by blocking M1, because you can avoid it anyway.

So why not approve both?

But there’s a **strategic concern**:

If you approve both, and opponent approves both, then both have 2 approvals → winner chosen at random.

Then you might get M1.

If you get M1, and you don't delegate, you’re fine.

But if you get M2, you might benefit.

But no downside.

So approving both is safe.

However, **you are Player 2**, and **M2 is your proposal**, so **you have a conflict of interest**: if you approve M1, you might be helping your opponent.

But your goal is to **maximize your points**, not to support your proposal.

But importantly: **you want to maximize the chance that M2 is selected**, because it has the potential to enable cooperation.

So you should **approve M2**.

For M1: if you approve it, it increases the chance M1 wins.

But M1 doesn't help coordination.

Moreover, if M1 wins, you can always choose not to delegate.

So **M1 is no worse than not having a mediator**.

But M2 is better, because it allows for cooperation.

So **replacing M1 with M2 is better**.

Therefore, you should **approve M2**, and **not approve M1**, so that if there’s a tie, M2 is more likely to win.

But with approvals, if you approve only M2, and opponent approves only M2, then M2 wins.

If opponent approves M1, then max approval is 1 for each → random.

But if you approve only M2, and opponent approves only M1, then max is 1 → random.

So **by not approving M1, you make it less likely that a mediator is selected that you dislike**, even if you can avoid it.

But since you can avoid it, it’s not critical.

However, to **minimize the chance of M1 being selected**, you should not approve M1.

Because if you approve M1, you increase its approval count.

And if you don't approve it, it can't win unless opponent approves it.

But if both approve it, it wins.

So to **maximize the chance that M2 wins**, you should approve M2 and not approve M1.

Moreover, since M2 enables mutual cooperation, which can give you 5 points, while M1 does not have that ability, **M2 is strategically superior**.

Therefore, you should only approve M2.

Final decision:

- Approve M2: **yes**
- Approve M1: **no**

===== Prompt [ID: f97f2d0a] [2026-01-19 21:07:05] =====
agent: openai/gpt-5.2(CoT)#P2
prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:

First, translate what “Delegate to Mediator (A2)” actually means in terms of the *final* action you’ll play:

- If I pick **A2** and the other player does **not** pick A2, then exactly **1** player delegated, so the mediator plays **A1 for me**.
- If both players pick **A2**, then **2** players delegated, so the mediator plays **A0 for both of us**.

So my effective outcomes are:

### Compare my options against each possible opponent choice

**If I play A2 (delegate):**
- Opp plays **A0** → I become **A1** → payoff = 3  
- Opp plays **A1** → I become **A1** → payoff = 3  
- Opp plays **A2** → both become **A0** → payoff = 5  

So A2 yields: **(vs A0: 3), (vs A1: 3), (vs A2: 5)**.

**If I play A1 directly:**
- vs A0: 3, vs A1: 3, vs A2 (opponent becomes A1): 3  
So A1 yields **3 in all cases**.

Therefore, **A2 weakly dominates A1** (never worse, sometimes better), so I should put **0% on A1**.

**Now compare A2 vs A0:**
- If opponent plays **A0**, then A0 gives 5 while A2 gives 3 (A0 better).
- If opponent plays **A2**, then A2 gives 5 while A0 gives 0 (A2 massively better).
- If opponent plays **A1**, then A2 gives 3 while A0 gives 0 (A2 better).

So **A2 is the safer choice**: it avoids the catastrophic 0-point outcomes that A0 can suffer if the other player delegates (or plays A1).

Given I want to maximize my points without knowing the other player’s move, the robust best choice is to **delegate with 100% probability**.

To decide which mediators I should approve, we need to evaluate the potential outcomes of both mediators based on the game rules and the payoffs.

First, let's summarize the given details:

### Payoff Matrix:
```
               Other Player
              |  A0  |  A1  |
    -------------------------
      | A0 |   5  |   0  |
You -------------------------
      | A1 |   3  |   3  |
```

### Mediator Proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates: action A1.
- If 2 players delegate: action A0.

### Mediator Proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates: action A0.
- If 2 players delegate: action A0.

Let's analyze each mediator and decide whether to approve them.

#### Mediator Proposed by Player 1:
1. **If 1 player delegates:**
   - The mediator will play action A1.
   - If only Player 2 delegates:
     - Player 2 (mediated action A1) vs. Player 1 (decides independently)
     - Payoff depends on Player 1’s action:
       - Player 1 chooses A0: (Player 1, Player 2) = (3, 0)
       - Player 1 chooses A1: (Player 1, Player 2) = (3, 3)
   
2. **If both players delegate:**
   - The mediator will play action A0.
   - (Player 1, Player 2) = (5, 5)

#### Mediator Proposed by Player 2:
1. **If 1 player delegates:**
   - The mediator will play action A0.
   - If only Player 2 delegates:
     - Player 2 (mediated action A0) vs. Player 1 (decides independently)
     - Payoff depends on Player 1’s action:
       - Player 1 chooses A0: (Player 1, Player 2) = (5, 5)
       - Player 1 chooses A1: (Player 1, Player 2) = (0, 3)
   
2. **If both players delegate:**
   - The mediator will play action A0.
   - (Player 1, Player 2) = (5, 5)

### Evaluating My Best Option:
Clearly, maximizing my points requires me to consider the strategies leading to higher payoffs:

- If both players delegate to Player 1’s mediator, the payoff will be (5, 5).
- If both players delegate to Player 2’s mediator, the payoff will also be (5, 5).

Player 2’s mediator provides a clear and consistent advantage for delegation because it always plays action A0. Player 1’s mediator only guarantees a high payoff (5, 5) when both players delegate, but if only one does, it leads to a less favorable outcome for Player 2.

### Conclusion:
Given my objective is to maximize my total points, I find that the mediator proposed by Player 2 guarantees a high payoff consistently. Therefore, I approve only the mediator proposed by Player 2.

### Final JSON Decision:
```json
{"M1": false, "M2": true}
```

This ensures that I secure the most consistent and beneficial outcomes in the game.

response:
To maximize the total points in this decision-making game, we need to evaluate the payoff structure and the role of the mediator.

### Payoff Analysis
The core of the game is a 2x2 coordination problem with the following points for Player 1:
-   **(A0, A0):** 5 points (Best cooperative outcome)
-   **(A0, A1):** 0 points
-   **(A1, A0):** 3 points
-   **(A1, A1):** 3 points (Safe outcome)

If you play A1, you are guaranteed **3 points** regardless of the other player's action. If you play A0, you receive either **5 points** (if the other player also chooses A0) or **0 points** (if they choose A1).

### The Mediator
The mediator plays action A0 if at least one player delegates (A2). This means:
-   If you delegate (A2) and the other player chooses A0 or A2, the final actions will be (A0, A0), giving you **5 points**.
-   If you delegate (A2) and the other player chooses A1, the final actions will be (A0, A1), giving you **0 points**.

Action A2 is functionally identical to action A0 in its payoff results. However, the context of the mediator is crucial. The mediator was proposed by you (Player 1) and approved by both players. This acts as a strong signal for coordination.

### Decision Strategy
This game has two Nash Equilibria:
1.  **Coordination on A0/A2 (5, 5):** The Pareto-optimal outcome where both players maximize their points.
2.  **Coordination on A1 (3, 3):** The risk-dominant outcome where players choose safety over the higher payoff.

In game theory scenarios involving proposed and approved mediators, the presence of the mediator serves to solve the coordination problem. By both players approving a mediator that plays A0, they have signaled their intent to move away from the "safe" A1 strategy toward the "optimal" (5, 5) payoff.

Since action A2 (delegation) is a commitment to the mediator's strategy (A0), and the mediator was established to facilitate the best possible outcome for both players, delegating to the mediator is the most logical choice to achieve the 5-point payoff.

### Final Action Distribution
Given that A0 and A2 lead to the same result, and A2 utilizes the provided coordination mechanism, we will allocate the probability to A2.

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The payoff matrix shows this is a coordination game where:
- (A0, A0) gives (5, 5) - the efficient outcome
- (A1, A1) gives (3, 3) - the safe outcome
- Miscoordination gives (0, 3) or (3, 0)

Without mediation, the Nash equilibrium is a mixed strategy where each player plays A0 with probability 0.6, yielding an expected payoff of 3 points each.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator M1 (Proposed by Player 1)

M1 always plays A0 regardless of how many players delegate.

**Delegation outcomes under M1:**
- Both delegate → M1 plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → (5, 5)
- Only I delegate → I play A0 (via M1), P1 best responds with A0 → (5, 5)
- Only P1 delegates → P1 plays A0 (via M1), I best respond with A0 → (5, 5)
- Neither delegates → Nash equilibrium → (3, 3)

**Result:** M1 achieves (5, 5) as long as at least one player delegates. This is very robust.

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator M2 (Proposed by Player 2)

M2 plays A1 if only one player delegates, A0 if both delegate.

**Delegation outcomes under M2:**
- Both delegate → M2 plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → (5, 5)
- Only I delegate → I play A1 (via M2), P1 best responds with A1 → (3, 3)
- Only P1 delegates → P1 plays A1 (via M2), I best respond with A1 → (3, 3)
- Neither delegates → Nash equilibrium → (3, 3)

**Result:** M2 only achieves (5, 5) if both players delegate. It requires perfect coordination.

## Step 4: Compare Mediators

Both mediators can achieve the efficient outcome (5, 5), but:
- **M1 is more robust**: Only requires one player to delegate to achieve (5, 5)
- **M2 is less robust**: Requires both players to delegate to achieve (5, 5)

M1 is strictly better from a risk/robustness perspective. Both mediators improve upon no mediation (5 > 3), but M1 provides the same best outcome with less coordination risk.

## Step 5: Strategic Approval Decision

Since M1 is more robust and achieves the same optimal outcome, I should approve M1. I should not approve M2 because:
- If I approve only M1, and P1 approves M1 (likely since they proposed it), we get M1
- If I approve both and P1 approves only M2, we'd be forced into the less robust M2

**Final Answer:**

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": false}
```

To maximize points in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix by evaluating the outcomes for each action, including the delegation option (A2).

### 1. Identify the Payoff Matrix
Based on the rules:
- **A0 vs A0**: (5, 5)
- **A1 vs A1**: (3, 3)
- **A0 vs A1**: (0, 3)
- **A1 vs A0**: (3, 0)

Now incorporate the **Mediator (A2)**:
- **A2 vs A0**: P1 delegates, P2 does not. Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result: (A1, A0) → Payoff: (3, 0)
- **A2 vs A1**: P1 delegates, P2 does not. Mediator plays A1 for P1. Result: (A1, A1) → Payoff: (3, 3)
- **A2 vs A2**: Both delegate. Mediator plays A0 for both. Result: (A0, A0) → Payoff: (5, 5)
- **A0 vs A2**: P2 delegates, P1 does not. Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result: (A0, A1) → Payoff: (0, 3)
- **A1 vs A2**: P2 delegates, P1 does not. Mediator plays A1 for P2. Result: (A1, A1) → Payoff: (3, 3)

The resulting payoff matrix for Player 1 is:
| | A0 | A1 | A2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| **A1** | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| **A2** | 3 | 3 | 5 |

### 2. Strategic Analysis
- **Dominance**: Action A2 weakly dominates Action A1. Against A0 and A1, A2 yields the same result as A1 (3 pts). However, against A2, A2 yields 5 points while A1 only yields 3. Therefore, A1 is never a better choice than A2.
- **Coordination**: The game simplifies to a coordination choice between (A0, A0) and (A2, A2), both yielding 5 points.
- **Risk Dominance**: If we compare A0 and A2:
    - If you choose A0 and the other player deviates from coordination, you receive **0**.
    - If you choose A2 and the other player deviates from coordination (chooses A0 or A1), you receive **3**.
- **The Twist**: Since Player 2 proposed this specific mediator, it signals a strong intention to utilize it. Action A2 is the "safe" way to achieve the maximum payoff of 5, as its worst-case scenario (3 pts) is significantly better than A0's worst-case scenario (0 pts).

### 3. Conclusion
Rational players will gravitate toward Action A2 because it is risk-dominant. It provides a safety net of 3 points while still allowing for the maximum mutual payoff of 5 if both players coordinate on the mediator.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:

response:
To maximize points in this game, let's analyze the payoff matrix using the available actions: A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate).

### Payoff Matrix
Based on the rules, we can construct a payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2, you):

| P1 \ P2 | A0 | A1 | A2 (Delegate) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A0** | (5, 5) | (0, 3) | (0, 3) |
| **A1** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (3, 3) |
| **A2** | (3, 0) | (3, 3) | (5, 5) |

### Strategic Analysis
1.  **Dominance:**
    *   For both players, action **A2** strictly dominates **A1**. A2 provides the same payoffs as A1 in every scenario except when both players choose A2, in which case it yields 5 points instead of 3.
    *   Since A1 is strictly dominated by A2, we can effectively remove it from consideration.

2.  **Coordination Game (A0 vs. A2):**
    After removing A1, we are left with a 2x2 coordination game:
    *   (A0, A0) → (5, 5)
    *   (A0, A2) → (0, 3)
    *   (A2, A0) → (3, 0)
    *   (A2, A2) → (5, 5)

3.  **Risk and Security:**
    *   **A0** is the "risky" coordination choice. If you play A0 and the other player plays A2, you receive 0 points.
    *   **A2** is the "safe" coordination choice. If you play A2, you are guaranteed at least 3 points regardless of what the other player does (as A2 yields 3 if the other plays A0 or A1, and 5 if they also play A2).
    *   Given that Player 1 proposed this mediator and it rewards mutual delegation with the maximum payoff (5, 5) while providing a high security floor (3 points), it is the most rational and focal choice for both players.

### Conclusion
By playing **A2**, you ensure a minimum of 3 points and set up a scenario where mutual coordination results in the maximum potential of 5 points. Since A2 dominates A1 and is risk-dominant compared to A0 (it has a higher security floor), we assign 100% probability to A2.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

To maximize points in this decision-making game, we first analyze the payoff matrix by incorporating the mediator's rules. The mediator (action A2) plays action A1 if only one player delegates and action A0 if both players delegate.

The payoff matrix for Player 1 and Player 2 is as follows:
- **(A0, A0):** (5, 5)
- **(A0, A1):** (0, 3)
- **(A1, A0):** (3, 0)
- **(A1, A1):** (3, 3)
- **(A0, A2):** (Player 2 delegates, mediator plays A1) → (A0, A1) = (0, 3)
- **(A1, A2):** (Player 2 delegates, mediator plays A1) → (A1, A1) = (3, 3)
- **(A2, A0):** (Player 1 delegates, mediator plays A1) → (A1, A0) = (3, 0)
- **(A2, A1):** (Player 1 delegates, mediator plays A1) → (A1, A1) = (3, 3)
- **(A2, A2):** (Both delegate, mediator plays A0) → (A0, A0) = (5, 5)

Summarized Matrix (P1, P2):
| | P2: A0 | P2: A1 | P2: A2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1: A0** | 5, 5 | 0, 3 | 0, 3 |
| **P1: A1** | 3, 0 | 3, 3 | 3, 3 |
| **P1: A2** | 3, 0 | 3, 3 | 5, 5 |

**Analysis:**
1. **Dominance:** A2 weakly dominates A1. For any action Player 2 takes, A2 provides a payoff equal to or greater than A1 ($3 \ge 3$, $3 \ge 3$, and $5 > 3$).
2. **Safety vs. Reward:** A0 can yield 5 but risks 0 if the opponent doesn't choose A0. A2 also yields 5 if the opponent chooses A2, but it guarantees a minimum of 3 (since the mediator plays A1) if the opponent chooses A0 or A1.
3. **Equilibria:** There are two main Nash equilibria outcomes: (A0, A0) and (A2, A2), both yielding (5, 5). However, A2 is a "safer" strategy than A0. If Player 2 follows the same logic, both players will choose A2 to ensure a minimum of 3 while coordinating for the maximum of 5.

Choosing A2 is the most robust strategy as it eliminates the risk of receiving 0 while still allowing for the maximum possible payoff through coordination.

response:
To approach this decision-making game, we need to carefully analyze the game dynamics and consider the payoff structure, the potential benefit of the mediator, and the behavior of Player 1 (the other player).

### Payoff Analysis:

1. **If both players independently choose:**
    - *Both choose A0*: Both get 5 points.
    - *Both choose A1*: Both get 3 points.
    - *Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 chooses A1*: Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
    - *Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 chooses A0*: Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.

2. **Mediator Influence:**
    - If Player 2 delegates (chooses A2) and Player 1 does not delegate, Player 2 will play A0 because only one player has delegated.
    - If both players delegate, the mediator will play A0 for both.

### Steps to Rationalize the Decision:

1. **Determine Best Strategies in Each Scenario:**
    - If both players independently play A0, they maximize their combined points.
    - If Player 2 selects A2 (delegate to mediator), we must consider whether Player 1 will likely delegate as well.
    - *Solo Delegation*: For Player 2 (you), if Player 1 does not delegate, you play A0.
    - *Double Delegation*: If both delegate, they both play A0, maximizing each player's payoff.

2. **Anticipate Player 1's Strategy:**
    - If Player 1 understands the benefits of mutual delegation, they might choose to delegate.
    - However, if Player 1 is risk-averse, they might prefer to play independently.

3. **Mixed Strategy Approach:**
    - Given the importance of cooperation for mutual benefit and the possibility that Player 1 might not delegate, Player 2 can allocate probabilities among A0, A1, and A2 to balance risks and rewards.

### Formulating the Mixed Strategy:

To maximize points:
- Encourage mutual delegation (delegate sometimes, but not always).
- Keep a portion for independent maximization (choosing A0 occasionally).

Based on these considerations, an appropriate mixed strategy for Player 2 (you) could look like this:

- Assign the highest probability to delegating to the mediator, as it leads to the optimal payoff if Player 1 also delegates.
- Allocate some probability to A0, ensuring some stable points even if Player 1 does not delegate and plays safely.
- Allocate minimal probability to A1, as it’s generally less beneficial unless Player 1 plays A0.

### Final Mixed Strategy:
Based on this rationale, a reasonable distribution might look like the following:

```json
{"A0": 20, "A1": 10, "A2": 70}
```

Explanation:
- **A0: 20%** - Safe and stable strategy.
- **A1: 10%** - Retain minimal risk/reward strategy.
- **A2: 70%** - Leverage mediator strategy to achieve mutual optimal results.

response:
To maximize total points in this coordination game, we must choose between the safer but lower-value action (A1) and the higher-value but riskier coordination action (A0 or A2).

1.  **Analyze the Payoff Matrix:**
    *   **A0 or A2 (Stag):** If both players coordinate on A0 or A2, they receive **5 points** each. However, if one player coordinates and the other chooses A1, the coordinating player receives **0 points**.
    *   **A1 (Hare):** Choosing A1 guarantees **3 points** regardless of the other player's decision.

2.  **Evaluate the Mediator (A2):**
    *   The mediator, proposed by Player 1 and approved by both players, effectively enforces the choice of A0.
    *   If Player 1 chooses A2 and Player 2 also chooses A2, both are assigned A0, resulting in the maximum payoff of (5, 5).
    *   If only one player chooses A2, the mediator still assigns A0 to that player.

3.  **Coordination Strategy:**
    *   The game is a variation of the "Stag Hunt." While A1 is risk-dominant (it guarantees 3 points), the (A0/A2, A0/A2) equilibrium is Pareto-superior (5 points). 
    *   The introduction of a mediator specifically for the purpose of playing A0, which was approved by both players, serves as a strong focal point for coordination. 
    *   Choosing A2 serves as a signal of intent to reach the (5, 5) outcome. Given that the players have already agreed to the mediator, there is a high probability that both will utilize it.

4.  **Expected Value Calculation:**
    *   Let $p$ be the probability that the other player chooses A1.
    *   The expected value of A2 (or A0) is $5(1-p) + 0(p) = 5 - 5p$.
    *   The expected value of A1 is $3$.
    *   Coordination on A2 is rational if $5 - 5p > 3$, which means $p < 0.4$. 
    *   Given the approval voting and the proposal of the mediator, it is highly likely that the probability of the other player choosing A1 is less than 40%.

Conclusion: To maximize expected total points, the most rational move is to coordinate on the best possible outcome by delegating the decision to the approved mediator.

response:
To maximize total points, let's analyze the game's payoffs and the role of the mediator.

### 1. Game Analysis (Player 2's Perspective)
The payoff structure for the basic actions (A0 and A1) is as follows:
- **(P1: A0, P2: A0):** Both get 5 points.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A0):** P1 gets 3, P2 (you) gets 0.
- **(P1: A0, P2: A1):** P1 gets 0, P2 (you) gets 3.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A1):** Both get 3 points.

For both players, action **A1** is a "safe" move, guaranteeing exactly 3 points Regardless of what the other player does.
Action **A0** is "risky"; it yields 5 points if the other player also chooses A0 but 0 points if the other player chooses A1.

### 2. The Mediator (Action A2)
The mediator plays action **A0** for anyone who delegates to it. 
- If you delegate (**A2**), you are effectively playing **A0**.
- If Player 1 delegates (**A2**), they are effectively playing **A0**.
- If both delegate, you both play **A0** and receive **5 points**.

### 3. Strategy and Coordination
This is a coordination game with two Nash Equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). 
- **(A0, A0)** is payoff-dominant (5 points vs 3 points).
- **(A1, A1)** is risk-dominant because A1 guarantees 3 points.

The "twist" is crucial: Player 1 proposed this mediator specifically to facilitate action A0. By proposing a mechanism that commits to A0, Player 1 is signaling a strong desire to reach the (5, 5) equilibrium. Player 1 gains nothing by "tricking" you into playing A0 (if they play A1, they get 3 points anyway); however, they gain an extra 2 points if you both coordinate successfully.

### 4. Conclusion
Since A2 is a formal tool for coordination proposed by Player 1, delegating to the mediator is the most rational way to achieve the maximum payoff of 5 points. If both players are rational and seek to maximize points, they will both choose to delegate.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Both proposed mediators are identical:

- If only I delegate, the mediator plays **A1**, which guarantees me **3 points** regardless of what Player 2 does (since my payoff with A1 is always 3).
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0**, yielding **(A0, A0)** and **5 points** for me.

So delegating under either mediator is never worse than acting independently (it secures at least 3) and can be better (5 if both delegate). Since **M1 and M2 are the same**, approving both weakly increases the chance that an approved mediator is selected, with no downside.

response:
To maximize the total points received, we analyze the payoff matrix and the impact of the mediator.

1.  **Analyze the Action Matrix (including A2):**
    The game has three potential actions for Player 1: A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate).
    Based on the payoff description and mediator rules:
    - **A0:**
        - If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 5, P2 gets 5.
        - If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
        - If P2 plays A2: P1 gets 5, P2 gets 5 (P2 delegates, mediator plays A0 for P2).
    - **A1:**
        - If P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0.
        - If P2 plays A1: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 3.
        - If P2 plays A2: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0 (P2 delegates, mediator plays A0 for P2).
    - **A2 (Delegate):**
        - If P2 plays A0: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A0 → Both get 5.
        - If P2 plays A1: P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
        - If P2 plays A2: Both play A0 → Both get 5.

2.  **Evaluate Nash Equilibria:**
    - There are two primary coordination states:
        - **Cooperative Equilibrium (A0 or A2):** If both players choose A0 or A2, they both receive 5 points.
        - **Safe Equilibrium (A1):** If a player plays A1, they are guaranteed 3 points regardless of the other player's action. However, the other player receives 0 if they attempt to cooperate.
    - Comparing the two:
        - Choosing A0 or A2 yields an expected payoff of $5p + 0(1-p) = 5p$, where $p$ is the probability the other player coordinates.
        - Choosing A1 yields a guaranteed payoff of 3.
        - A0/A2 is the superior choice if $5p > 3$, or $p > 0.6$.

3.  **The Role of the Mediator:**
    The mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected through approval voting by both players. This acts as a clear focal point and signaling mechanism for cooperation. By approving a mediator that always plays A0, both players have signaled their intention to aim for the payoff-dominant outcome of (5, 5). 

4.  **Conclusion:**
    Given that both players approved a mediator specifically designed to play A0, it is highly probable that Player 2 will delegate (A2) or play A0, making $p$ significantly higher than 0.6. As Player 1 (the proposer of the mediator), choosing A2 is the most consistent and beneficial strategy to ensure a payoff of 5.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Both proposed mediators have the same policy:

- If **both** players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for each, yielding **(5,5)** — the best mutual outcome.
- If **only one** player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for the delegator, which guarantees the delegator gets **at least 3** regardless of what the other player does (since A1 vs A0 gives 3, and A1 vs A1 gives 3). This protects the delegator from the worst-case 0 outcome.

So this mediator design creates an upside (possible coordination on (A0,A0)) with no real downside for me relative to acting independently, and since both mediators are identical, approving both only increases the probability that this favorable kind of mediator is selected.

So the “bad” outcome to avoid is being the only one playing **A0** while the other plays **A1** (I get 0).

### 2) Evaluate Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)
- If **both** delegate → mediator plays **A0** → aims for the high-payoff coordination (5,5) if both delegate.
- If **only one** player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that player → this *protects the lone delegator* from the worst-case (it avoids getting 0 due to unilateral “cooperation”).

So M1 is designed to be *safe* if delegation is miscoordinated, while still enabling (A0,A0) when both delegate.

### 3) Evaluate Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)
- If **one** delegates → mediator plays **A0**.
- If **both** delegate → mediator plays **A0**.

This makes unilateral delegation risky: if I delegate but the other doesn’t and plays **A1**, I can get **0**.

### 4) Approval strategy (key strategic consideration)
If I approve **both** M1 and M2, and Player 2 approves only M2 (plausible), then M2 would win outright (2 approvals vs 1), which exposes me to that unilateral-delegation risk.
If I approve **only M1**, then:
- If Player 2 approves only M2 → tie → mediator chosen randomly between M1 and M2 (better than guaranteeing M2).
- If Player 2 approves both → M1 wins (best).
- If Player 2 approves only M1 → M1 wins (best).

So approving only M1 weakly dominates approving both, from my perspective.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

|        | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| P2: A0 | 5, 5   | 0, 3   |
| P2: A1 | 3, 0   | 3, 3   |

The game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → both get 5 points ✓ (best outcome)
- (A1, A1) → both get 3 points (worse outcome)

The problem is coordination: without help, we might fail to coordinate on the better (A0, A0) equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze Both Mediators

**M1 and M2 are identical:**
- If 1 player delegates: plays A1
- If 2 players delegate: plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze the Delegation Game

Once a mediator is selected, we each decide whether to delegate (D) or act independently (I):

**Outcomes:**
- **(D, D)**: Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → **payoffs (5, 5)**
- **(D, I)**: Mediator plays A1 for delegating player
  - If P2 delegates, P1 independent: P2 gets A1, P1's best response is A1 → (3, 3)
  - If P1 delegates, P2 independent: P1 gets A1, P2's best response is A1 → (3, 3)
- **(I, I)**: Back to original game with coordination risk

## Step 4: Evaluate the Equilibrium

The delegation game has **(D, D)** as a strong Nash equilibrium:
- If opponent delegates, I get 5 from delegating vs 3 from not delegating
- Both players have incentive to delegate
- This guarantees the Pareto optimal outcome (5, 5)

## Step 5: Decision

Both mediators:
- Are identical in design
- Solve the coordination problem
- Create incentives for both players to delegate
- Guarantee the best possible outcome (5, 5)

This is clearly beneficial for me as Player 2 compared to risking mis-coordination in the original game.

response:
The game described is a coordination game with two pure-strategy Nash equilibria: (A0, A0), which yields (5, 5), and (A1, A1), which yields (3, 3). While (A0, A0) provides the maximum possible payoff for both players, choosing A0 independently is risky, as it yields 0 points if the other player chooses A1. Action A1 is a "safe" move, guaranteeing exactly 3 points regardless of the other player's decision.

The proposed mediators (M1 and M2) are identical and act as commitment mechanisms to facilitate the (A0, A0) equilibrium. The mediator's logic is as follows:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator plays the safe action (A1) for that player. Knowing this, the non-delegating player would also logically choose A1 to maximize their payoff (getting 3 points instead of 0), leading to the safe (3, 3) outcome.
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both, resulting in the optimal (5, 5) outcome.

Because both mediators are identical and provide a risk-free way for both players to commit to the socially optimal outcome, Player 2 should approve both.

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## 1. Understanding the Payoff Matrix (from my perspective as Player 2)

|          | P1: A0 | P1: A1 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **P2: A0** | 5      | 0      |
| **P2: A1** | 3      | 3      |

## 2. Understanding the Mediator

The mediator always plays **A0** regardless of whether 1 or 2 players delegate. This means:
- **Delegating (A2) is functionally equivalent to playing A0**
- Both choices result in action A0 being executed for me

## 3. Finding the Nash Equilibrium

For this game, let me find when each player is indifferent between actions.

**My indifference condition:**
- Expected payoff from A0: 5×(prob P1 plays A0)
- Expected payoff from A1: 3 (always)
- I'm indifferent when: 5p = 3, so p = 0.6

**Player 1's indifference condition (by symmetry):**
- They need me to play A0 with probability 0.6

**Nash Equilibrium:** Each player plays A0 with 60% probability, A1 with 40% probability.
- Expected payoff at NE: 3.72 points each

## 4. Strategic Considerations

The key insights:
- **Cooperation (A0, A0):** Both get 5 points - Pareto optimal
- **Nash Equilibrium:** Both get 3.72 points - hedging against uncertainty
- **Safe Option (A1):** Guarantees 3 points - protection against being exploited

Player 1 proposed a mediator that plays A0, signaling intent to cooperate. This suggests they may delegate to achieve the (5,5) outcome.

## 5. Optimal Strategy

I'll use a mixed strategy that:
- **Primarily delegates** (60%) - leveraging the cooperation mechanism Player 1 created
- **Hedges with A1** (30%) - protecting against the risk that Player 1 defects
- **Occasionally plays A0 directly** (10%) - maintains some unpredictability while still cooperating

This balances cooperation with the mediator against the Nash equilibrium hedge.

response:
To tackle this decision-making problem, we need to analyze the proposed mediators and determine which one(s) align with our strategy and goals. We are in the position of Player 2 and our objective is to maximize our total points in the game. Let's break down the steps to make a well-informed decision:

### Step 1: Understand the Game Payoff Matrix
We have the following payoff matrix (Player 2 is the row player, Player 1 is the column player):

|              | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Player 2: A0 | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| Player 2: A1 | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

### Step 2: Analyzing Each Mediator's Design
#### Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- If only 1 player delegates to this mediator, it will play A1.
- If both players delegate to this mediator, it will play A0.

#### Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- If only 1 player delegates to this mediator, it will play A0.
- If both players delegate to this mediator, it will play A0.

### Step 3: Determine the Outcome of Each Mediator
- **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
  - Solo delegation: Plays A1.
    - If Player 1 delegates (plays A1):
      - If Player 2 plays independently and chooses A0, Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
      - If Player 2 plays independently and chooses A1, both get 3 points.
  - Both delegate: Plays A0 (best for both: 5 points each).

- **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
  - Solo delegation: Plays A0.
    - If Player 1 delegates (chooses A1):
      - If Player 2 plays independently and chooses A0, Player 2 gets 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
  - Both delegate: Plays A0 (best for both: 5 points each).

### Step 4: Determine Which Mediator(s) to Approve
- Mediator proposed by Player 2 always plays A0, which has the potential to either give us 5 points (if both delegate or Player 1 plays A0) or 0 points if Player 1 plays A1.
- Mediator proposed by Player 1 plays A1 in the solo delegation scenario, which is less beneficial (3 points max for both) compared to the guaranteed A0 in the dual delegation scenario (5 points each).

### Conclusion:
The rational decision is to approve only the mediator that appears to align best with maximizing Player 2’s points. Based on the analysis above, the Mediator proposed by Player 2 fits that criterion better as it favors action A0 consistently, which tends to deliver higher points.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the optimal strategy for **Player 2**, who is trying to **maximize their expected points** in this game.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

This is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with the following payoff matrix (for **Player 2**, since we are in the role of Player 2):

| Your Action \ Other Player's Action | A0        | A1        |
|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| A0                                  | 5,5       | 0,3       |
| A1                                  | 3,0       | 3,3       |

Note: Since we are Player 2, we care about our own payoffs:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 3
- (A1, A1): 3

This is **not** a symmetric game in payoffs, so we must be careful.

---

### Step 2: Introduce the Delegation Option (Action A2)

You now have a third action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**.

If you delegate, the mediator will play **A1** if **only 1 player** delegates, and **A0** if **both players** delegate.

The mediator is **not a player** — it's a mechanism that executes based on the **number of delegates**.

So, two cases:
- If **only you** delegate → mediator plays A1
- If **you and the other player** both delegate → mediator plays A0
- If **no one** delegates → you play yourself, as normal
- If **only the other player** delegates → their mediator plays A1 (if only they delegate), so the other player's action is A1

Note: There is **only one mediator**, and both players can choose to delegate to it.

So possible delegate counts:
- 0: no one delegates → both play their own actions
- 1: one player delegates → mediator plays A1
- 2: both delegate → mediator plays A0

---

### Step 3: Model the Game with Delegation

We now need to model the game as a simultaneous choice between **A0, A1, A2**.

Let me define:
- Your strategy: choose probabilities for A0, A1, A2 → let’s denote:
  - $ p_0 $: P(choose A0)
  - $ p_1 $: P(choose A1)
  - $ p_2 $: P(choose A2) = 1 - p_0 - p_1

The other player (Player 1) also chooses a strategy (not specified, but we need to find a Nash equilibrium or best response).

But since the problem asks for **your** strategy to **maximize your total points**, and you are told to choose a **mixed strategy** (possibly in equilibrium), the optimal solution likely lies in a symmetric equilibrium or in a strategy that is robust against any opponent strategy.

However, the twist is that delegation gives **deterministic** behavior depending on **how many people delegate**.

Let’s compute **expected payoffs** based on different strategies.

---

### Step 4: Analyze the Delegation Mechanism

Let’s suppose you choose a strategy with probabilities $ p_0 $, $ p_1 $, $ p_2 $.

Let $ q $ be the probability that the other player delegates (i.e., chooses A2).

Then the **total number of delegates** is a random variable: 0, 1, or 2.

We can compute your **expected payoff** as a function of $ p_0, p_1, p_2 $ and $ q $.

But since **you are choosing your strategy**, and you don't know the other player’s strategy, you must assume they might play optimally or you must find a **best response** or **equilibrium strategy**.

But here's a key insight: **The mediator’s behavior is deterministic based on number of delegates**, so the outcome is **deterministic if both players’ choices are known**, but random due to randomness in strategy.

Let me consider **pure strategies** first.

---

### Step 5: Consider Equilibrium Candidates

Let’s consider whether there’s a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium** where both players do the same.

But note: this game is **not symmetric** in payoffs. Wait — is it?

Wait: Let's double-check the payoffs:

From **Player 2’s perspective**:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A1, A0): 3
- (A1, A1): 3

Now, **Player 1’s payoffs** are:
- (A0, A0): 5
- (A0, A1): 3
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): 3

So, it **is symmetric** in the sense that both players get the same payoffs when actions are swapped.

Wait: compare:
- When both play A0: both get 5 → symmetric
- When Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 plays A1: Player 2 gets 0, Player 1 gets 3
- When Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 plays A0: Player 2 gets 3, Player 1 gets 0 → symmetric
- When both play A1: both get 3

So the game **is symmetric**: the payoff structure is symmetric under swapping players and actions.

Therefore, we can reasonably assume that **both players will play the same strategy** in equilibrium.

We are Player 2, so we can look for a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

---

### Step 6: Consider What Happens with Delegation

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy:
- P(A0) = x
- P(A1) = y
- P(A2) = z
- With x + y + z = 1

Because of symmetry, both players use the same strategy.

Then:
- P(0 delegates) = (1 - z)^2
- P(1 delegate) = 2z(1 - z)
- P(2 delegates) = z^2

Now, we can compute your **expected payoff** as a function of x, y, z.

But actually, since you are in a symmetric equilibrium, we can analyze whether it’s rational to delegate.

Let’s suppose both players are symmetric.

But delegation is **not symmetric** in outcome: if only one delegates, mediator plays A1; if both, plays A0.

Now, is there a **dominant** action? Let’s analyze.

---

### Step 7: Evaluate Payoffs for Each Choice (Conditional on Opponent)

Let’s suppose the **opponent** uses some strategy.

But since we want robustness, let’s consider **what happens if the other player delegates** or not.

Let’s suppose you consider your **best response** to the opponent's choice.

But since we are choosing first, the best strategy should be **independent of what the other player does**, because we don’t know — so we must assume they are also optimizing.

Let’s analyze **expected payoff** under different choices.

Let’s define:

Let’s suppose the **other player** chooses a strategy with P(delegate) = q.

We will compute your **expected payoff** for choosing A0, A1, or A2.

Then, we will pick the strategy that maximizes your **minimax or expected** payoff.

But since it’s a one-shot game and you want to **maximize total points**, and both players are rational, we want a **Nash equilibrium**.

But perhaps there’s a **unique equilibrium**.

Let’s consider possible equilibria.

---

### Step 8: Try Pure Strategy: Both Delegates (A2)

Suppose both players choose A2 (delegate).

Then: 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0.

So both players get action A0.

Then payoff: (A0, A0) → each gets 5.

So expected payoff = 5.

Now, is this an equilibrium?

Suppose you are playing A2, other player is playing A2.

Can you **deviate** and get more?

Suppose you instead play A0, while the other still delegates.

Then: you play A0, other delegates (so they play A0), so outcome is (A0, A0), you get 5 — same as before.

If you play A1: you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3 → worse than 5.

So you get 5 for A0, 3 for A1, 5 for A2.

So no incentive to deviate — you are happy.

Is this stable?

But wait: what if the other player deviates?

Suppose you play A2, other plays A2 → payoff 5.

If other plays A0 instead → then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1.

Other plays A0 → so (A1, A0): you get 3, other gets 0.

So other gets 0, which is worse than 5.

So other has no incentive to deviate.

So **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium**: both get 5.

---

### Step 9: Try (A0, A0) — no delegation

Both play A0.

Payoff: 5 each.

Can you deviate?

If you play A1 instead: you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3 < 5 → worse.

So no incentive.

But wait: can you do better?

Suppose you play A2 → delegate.

Then: only you delegate → mediator plays A1.

Other plays A0 → so outcome is (A1, A0): you get 3 < 5 → worse.

So no incentive to deviate.

So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But both get only 5 — same as (A2, A2).

Is (A1, A1) an equilibrium?

Both play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3.

If you deviate to A0: (A0, A1) → you get 0 < 3 → no good.

If you deviate to A2: now only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → other plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3 → same.

So you are indifferent.

But if you deviate to A0 → you get 0 → worse.

So no incentive to deviate.

So (A1, A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But payoff is only 3 — worse than 5.

So not attractive.

---

### Step 10: What about mixed strategies?

Let’s see if we can get **higher than 5** expected payoff?

No — maximum possible in any case is 5 (in (A0, A0)).

So best possible is 5.

So both (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) give 5.

Now, is there a **better** equilibrium?

No — 5 is maximum.

But can we make expected payoff **more than 5**? No, because 5 is the maximum.

So if we expect to get 5, that's optimal.

But now the real issue: **which equilibrium to choose**?

But also: the **mediator’s action** depends on numbers.

Now, notice: if **both players delegate**, you get (A0, A0) → 5 each.

If neither delegates and both play A0, you also get 5.

But now, consider **if one player delegates**.

Suppose you delegate (A2), other plays A0 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1, other plays A0 → payoff (A1, A0) → you get **3**.

That's worse than 5.

But if **both delegate**, you get 5.

So delegation **only helps if the other player also delegates**.

But if only you delegate, you get only 3.

So delegation is a **risky move**, unless you believe the other player will also delegate.

But if both are rational, **why would anyone delegate**?

But in (A2, A2), it works: you get 5.

But is it **better to delegate** than to play A0?

In that case, it's indistinguishable: both get 5.

But now, here’s a twist: **what if you want to coordinate on A0**?

But the original game has no coordination — but the mediator **can help coordinate** when both delegate.

Wait — if both delegate, **you are forced to A0**.

So delegation effectively **forces both to play A0**, which is good for both.

But if only one delegates, the delegatees play A1, and the other plays A0 → you get 3.

So **delegation is a way to coordinate on A0**, but only if **both** do it.

But if only one does it, it’s bad.

So it's a **coordinating device**, but with risk.

Now, consider if **you delegate**, and you believe the other player will also delegate.

Then you get 5.

If you play A0 and the other plays A0, you also get 5.

So same payoff.

But delegation might be **riskier**: if they don’t delegate, you get only 3.

But if they do delegate, you get 5.

So **delegation doesn't improve** your payoff — it’s just **a way to try to coordinate**.

But in a symmetric equilibrium, what would happen?

Suppose both players are symmetric and rational.

Let’s suppose the players are **risk-averse** or want to **maximize expected payoff**.

Suppose you consider **your expected payoff** from **delegating**.

Let’s suppose the **other player** delegates with probability q.

Then, your expected payoff from **delegating (A2)**:

- With probability q: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 5
- With probability (1 - q): only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get payoff based on other player’s action

Now, if other player does **not** delegate, they are playing their own action — which could be A0 or A1.

But we don’t know what they choose.

Let’s assume they are also mixing.

But perhaps try to find a symmetric mixed strategy.

Let me suppose both players use the same mixed strategy: P(A0) = x, P(A1) = y, P(A2) = z, x + y + z = 1.

Now, you want to find a symmetric equilibrium.

Let’s suppose the symmetric equilibrium is **both players play A2** → z = 1, x = y = 0.

We already saw that this is an equilibrium, payoff = 5.

Is there another symmetric equilibrium?

Suppose instead that both players play A0 with probability 1 → x = 1.

Then, payoff = 5.

But now, if you deviate to A2, and they play A0, then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3 < 5 → not worth.

So no incentive.

But now, what if the other player plays a mixed strategy?

But here's a better idea: in the **original game (without delegation)**, what is the Nash equilibrium?

In the base game:

Payoff matrix (Player 2’s view):

|         | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------|---------|---------|
| A0 (you) | 5       | 0       |
| A1 (you) | 3       | 3       |

Let’s find Nash equilibrium in this game.

Suppose Player 1 plays A0 with prob p, A1 with (1 - p).

Your best response:

- If you play A0: expected payoff = p*5 + (1-p)*0 = 5p
- If you play A1: expected payoff = p*3 + (1-p)*3 = 3

So you prefer A0 if 5p > 3 → p > 3/5 = 0.6

You prefer A1 if p < 0.6

If p = 0.6, indifferent.

So symmetric equilibrium: Player 1 plays A0 with 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Then your best response: since 5p = 5*0.6 = 3 = payoff from A1 → so you are indifferent.

So you can play a mix.

Let’s find symmetric equilibrium.

Suppose both play A0 with prob p.

Then, for you to be willing to mix between A0 and A1, the expected payoff must be equal.

Player 1’s action:
- A0: prob p
- A1: prob 1-p

Your payoff from playing A0: p*5 + (1-p)*0 = 5p
Your payoff from playing A1: p*3 + (1-p)*3 = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So symmetric mixed strategy: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

Then expected payoff: 3 (since both give 3)

But wait — earlier we had equilibria with payoff 5.

But those are **pure strategy equilibria**.

In fact, there are **three pure strategy Nash equilibria** in the base game:
1. (A0, A0): both get 5
2. (A1, A1): both get 3
3. (A0, A1): (0, 3) — is this equilibrium? If Player 2 plays A0, Player 1 plays A1, then if Player 1 switches to A0, gets 5 > 3 → so no.
Similarly, (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3, Player 1 gets 0 — if Player 1 switches to A1, gets 3 > 0 → so not equilibrium.

So only two pure strategy NE: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

But (A1,A1) gives only 3 — worse.

So (A0,A0) is **best** for both.

Now, back to delegation.

In the **delegated version**, we have the option to **commit to a coordinated action** via delegation.

Suppose both players **agree to delegate**.

Then they both get (A0, A0) → 5.

If they don’t delegate, and play independently, they might not reach (A0, A0).

But if they both **delegate**, they are forced to A0.

Is this an equilibrium?

Yes — as we saw earlier.

But now, the **key insight**:

In the original game, without delegation, (A0, A0) is an equilibrium, but it's **not unique** — (A1,A1) is also an equilibrium.

But delegation allows players to **coordinate on A0** and avoid the bad equilibrium.

But in our case, we are told that the **mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected**.

Moreover, we are to choose a strategy.

Now, the question is: **what should your strategy be?**

But here’s a deeper observation:

If you **both delegate**, you get A0 for both → you get 5.

If you don’t delegate, you might not coordinate.

But now, suppose you are playing **A2** — delegate.

Then your action becomes **determined by the number of delegates**.

You don’t get to choose.

But the **payoff depends on how many delegate**.

Now, if **both players delegate**, you get 5.

If only one delegates, you get A1, and other player plays their own action.

But if the other player plays A0, you get (A1, A0) → 3.

If other plays A1, you get (A1, A1) → 3.

So **if only you delegate**, you get 3.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and play A0, and the other plays A0, you get 5.

But if the other plays A1, you get 0.

So to get 5, you need the other to play A0.

But now, **if both delegate**, you **force** both to play A0, so you get 5 **for sure**, regardless of what the other player would have done.

So delegation **eliminates uncertainty**.

But you only get this if the other player also delegates.

So delegation is like a **coordination device**.

Now, if both players are rational and know this, and both prefer 5 over 3, then both have incentive to delegate, **as long as they believe the other will too**.

But is it **stable**?

Yes — as we saw in (A2, A2), it is a Nash equilibrium.

Moreover, in this equilibrium, you get 5.

But also, (A0, A0) is an equilibrium — you get 5.

So you get 5 in both.

But now, **can you do better than 5?** No.

So either is fine.

But now, suppose you **choose to delegate with probability 1**.

Then you get 5 **only if the other player also delegates**.

But if the other player does **not** delegate, you get 3.

So your **expected payoff** depends on their strategy.

If the other player is also rational and believes delegation leads to coordination, they might delegate.

But to maximize **your own worst-case** or **expected payoff**, what’s the best?

But here’s a crucial point: **you are to choose a strategy to maximize your points**.

And the game is symmetric.

Now, suppose both players use the same strategy: they delegate with probability z.

Then, probability both delegate = z^2 → payoff = 5

Probability only you delegate = z(1 - z) → then you play A1, other plays their own action.

But if they are symmetric, they play A0 with x, A1 with y.

But this is getting complex.

But in the **unique equilibrium where both players delegate (z=1)**, you get 5 for sure.

In the equilibrium where both play A0 (x=1, y=0, z=0), you also get 5.

But in the latter, you have to **trust** that the other player plays A0.

But if the other player plays A1 with positive probability, you might get less.

But in **pure strategy (A0, A0)**, you get 5.

But here’s the twist: **if you delegate, you are not playing A0** — you are letting the mediator play A0 only if **two delegates**.

But if **only you** delegate, you get A1.

So you get **only 3** in that case.

Whereas if you play A0 yourself, and other plays A0, you get 5.

So **delegation is risky**.

But in **equilibrium**, if both delegate, you get 5.

So it’s **safe only if both do it**.

Now, the question is: **What should you do?**

But notice: **delegation gives you an option to coordinate on A0**, which is good.

But you have to **commit** to it.

But here’s the key: if you play A0 with probability 1 **without delegation**, you get 5 only if the other player also plays A0.

If they play A1, you get 0.

But if you delegate, and the other delegates, you get 5.

If only you delegate, you get 3.

So **delegation is better if you believe the other player will delegate**, but worse if they won’t.

But if the other player is rational, they might also delegate, because they get the same benefit.

So **(A2, A2)** is a **safe equilibrium**: both players get 5.

Moreover, **delegation removes the possibility of the other player playing A1**, which could hurt you.

By delegating, you **force yourself to A0 if both delegate**, so you avoid the risk of playing A0 against A1.

Wait — no: if you delegate and only you delegate, you play A1 — which is worse.

But if you **do not delegate**, and the other plays A1, you get 0 if you played A0.

So you are worse off.

Wait — let’s compare:

Scenario 1: You do **not delegate**, choose A0.

Then:
- If other plays A0: you get 5
- If other plays A1: you get 0

So expected payoff depends on other player’s mix.

Scenario 2: You delegate (A2).

Then:
- If other delegates: you get 5
- If other does not delegate: you get 3 (because you play A1, other plays their action — but you get 3 in either case)

So if the other player plays A1 with positive probability, your expected payoff from delegation is **higher** than from A0, **if the other player is not always A0**.

For example, suppose the other player plays A1 with probability 0.5.

Then:

- If you play A0: expected payoff = 5*0.5 + 0*0.5 = 2.5
- If you play A2: expected payoff = 5*q + 3*(1-q), where q = P(other delegates)

But if q = 0.5, then 5*0.5 + 3*0.5 = 2.5 + 1.5 = 4

Which is **better than 2.5**.

And if q = 1, you get 5.

Even if q = 0.5, you get 4 > 2.5.

So delegation is better.

Similarly, if you play A1: expected payoff is 3 in any case.

So A2 gives 5q + 3(1-q) = 3 + 2q

So if q > 0, it’s better than 3.

And compared to A0, it’s better if 3 + 2q > 5p, where p = P(other plays A0)

But if p is not 1, then A2 can be better.

In fact, even if the other player plays a mixed strategy, delegation might be better.

But in equilibrium, both players will delegate if it’s mutually beneficial.

Moreover, if both players think the other will delegate, then both have incentive to delegate.

In fact, let’s try to find the symmetric equilibrium where both use the same strategy.

Suppose both players use a strategy: play A2 with probability z, A0 with (1-z)/2, A1 with (1-z)/2, say.

But this is complicated.

But here’s a simpler thought: **delegation can be used to escape the risk of A1**, and force coordination on A0.

And in the symmetric case, both players benefit from delegating.

In fact, the (A2, A2) equilibrium gives 5, which is better than the mixed strategy equilibrium which gives only 3.

So it’s **better**.

And it’s stable.

Moreover, since the mediator was **proposed by Player 2 and selected**, it is available.

Now, back to the question: **what should your strategy be?**

Since (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium and gives you 5, which is the maximum possible, and since you want to **maximize your points**, you should play a strategy that ensures you get 5.

But if you play A2 with probability 1, and the other player plays A2, you get 5.

But if they don’t, you get only 3.

But in equilibrium, they will play A2.

But are there any other equilibria?

Yes.

But suppose you want to **maximize your guaranteed minimum**.

If you play A2 with probability 1:
- Minimum payoff: 3 (if other doesn't delegate)
- Maximum: 5

If you play A0 with probability 1:
- Minimum: 0
- Maximum: 5

So delegation has **higher minimum**.

So it’s **more robust**.

For example, if you play A0, and other plays A1, you get 0.

If you delegate, and other plays A1, you get 3.

So much better.

Even if you are uncertain about the other player, delegation reduces risk.

Moreover, in a symmetric equilibrium, both will delegate.

In fact, **delegation is a dominant strategy**?

Let’s test.

Suppose the other player plays A0 with certainty.

Then:
- If you play A0: get 5
- If you play A1: get 3
- If you play A2: get 5 (since if other plays A0 and you delegate, only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3)

So you get 3 from A2.

So better to play A0 than A2.

So not dominant.

But if other player might play A1, then A2 is better.

So not dominant.

But in equilibrium, if both players expect the other to delegate, then playing A2 is best.

So (A2, A2) is an equilibrium.

And it’s a **better equilibrium** than others because it gives the highest possible payoff.

Moreover, it’s **unique in giving 5**, while (A0, A0) is fragile.

But the key insight from game theory: **delegation allows coordination on A0**, which is the best outcome.

And since both players benefit from it, and it’s a Nash equilibrium, it’s reasonable to use it.

Now, the question is: **what should you do?**

Since you want to maximize your points, and (A2, A2) gives 5, and is an equilibrium, and is robust, you should **choose to delegate with high probability**.

But can you do better than 5? No.

So to guarantee 5, you must ensure both delegate.

But you can’t ensure that.

But if you delegate, and the other player also delegates, you get 5.

But if you don’t delegate, and they play A1, you get 0 or 3.

So the best is to **coordinate**.

But how?

You can **commit** to delegation.

And since the other player knows that if both delegate, you both get 5, and if only one delegates, you get 3, which is better than 0, they might also delegate.

In fact, **delegation is a way to coordinate on the Pareto-efficient outcome**.

And since it's available, and symmetric, we should use it.

Moreover, in the description, the mediator was "proposed and approved", so it's active.

Now, here’s the final argument:

If you play **A0**, you get at most 5, but you risk getting 0.

If you play **A2**, you get at least 3.

And if the other player is rational and sees this, they will delegate too, so you both get 5.

But if you play a mixed strategy, you might dilute.

But in fact, the **optimal strategy is to delegate with probability 1**.

Because in equilibrium, both do it, and you get 5.

If you don't delegate, you risk getting less.

And there is no downside in delegation in equilibrium.

In fact, if you think the other player might play A1, delegation gives you 3 instead of 0.

So it’s strictly better.

Therefore, **play A2 with probability 1**.

But wait — is there a better strategy?

Suppose you play a mixed strategy.

But if you play A0 with 30%, A2 with 70%, then:

- If other plays A2: P=0.7 → if you play A2, you get 5
- But if you play A0, you get 5 only if they play A0, etc.

But it's messy.

The **simplest and most robust strategy** that leads to the high payoff is to **delegate**.

And since it's a best response to the other player also delegating, and it gives the highest possible payoff, we should choose it.

Moreover, in the problem, you are told that the mediator was designed to play A1 if only one delegates, A0 if both.

This means that the **design is to encourage coordination** — both delegates → A0.

So it's a **coordination device**.

To maximize your points, you should use it.

Therefore, the best strategy is to **always delegate**.

So choose A2 with 100%.

But let's check the final answer format.

You must output a JSON with A0, A1, A2.

So {"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

But is this correct?

Wait — what if the other player doesn't delegate? You get only 3.

But if you don't delegate, and they play A0, you get 5.

But if they play A1, you get 0.

So you are risking going from 5 to 0 by not delegating, but from 3 to 5 by delegating.

So if you believe the other player might play A1, delegation is better.

And if they play A1 with any probability, delegation is better.

But in equilibrium, they will play A2.

So yes.

Alternatively, suppose you play A2 with probability 100.

Then you get 5 if they play A2, 3 otherwise.

But they will play A2 if they know you will.

So likely 5.

The expected payoff in equilibrium is 5.

If you play A0, you get 5 only if they play A0, which might not be the case.

So yes.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to choose A2 with probability 100.

Final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

response:
Both proposed mediators have the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for the delegator. This protects a lone delegator from getting the worst outcome (choosing A0 while the other plays A1 gives 0).
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both, which achieves the best mutual outcome **(A0, A0) = 5 points each**.

So these mediators create a good “coordination device”: mutual delegation yields the high-payoff outcome, while unilateral delegation defaults to the safer action. Since M1 and M2 are identical, approving both doesn’t introduce any downside (even if the winner is chosen randomly among top-approved mediators).

Both proposed mediators are identical:

- If I’m the only one who delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for me, which guarantees me **3 points** regardless of what the other player does (since my payoff with A1 is always 3).
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both, yielding **(A0, A0)** and giving me **5 points**.

So delegating under either mediator is never worse than acting independently (it weakly improves outcomes), and could strictly improve outcomes if both delegate. Since M1 and M2 are the same, I approve both.

response:
First, note that the mediator’s behavior makes **delegating (A2)** at least as good as directly playing **A1**:

- If I play **A1** myself, my payoff depends on Player 1’s action in the usual way.
- If I play **A2** and **only I delegate**, the mediator plays **A1** for me anyway, so I get exactly what I would have gotten from playing **A1**.
- If I play **A2** and **both players delegate**, the mediator plays **A0** for both, giving me **5**, which is strictly better than the **3** I’d get from (A1, A1).

So **A2 weakly dominates A1**, and I should assign **0%** to A1.

That leaves choosing between **A0** and **A2**. If Player 1 also chooses A2, then choosing A2 gives me **5** (since both delegate), while choosing A0 against their delegation would give me **0** (because they’d be forced into A1). This makes **A2** the safer, risk-dominant coordination choice in the expanded game.

So I delegate with probability 1.

Mediator **M1** is better for me because it makes *delegating* safe even if I’m the only one who delegates: the mediator plays **A1**, which guarantees me **3 points** regardless of what the other player does. If both delegate, M1 plays **A0** for both, achieving the efficient outcome **(A0, A0)** worth **5 points** each. So M1 both (a) protects against being exploited when delegation is unilateral and (b) enables coordination on the best joint outcome when delegation is mutual.

Mediator **M2** is riskier because if I delegate unilaterally it commits me to **A0**, which can yield **0** if the other player plays **A1**. Since mediator selection is randomized among top-approved options, approving M2 would sometimes saddle me with this worse mediator.

response:
To maximize my total points in this game where delegation to a mediator is an option, I need to carefully consider both the payoffs and the mediator's predetermined behavior. Here is the breakdown of my reasoning step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Basic Game Structure and Payoffs**:
   - If both players choose A0, both get 5 points.
   - If I choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, I get 0 points while they get 3.
   - If I choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, I get 3 points while they get 0.
   - If both players choose A1, both get 3 points.

2. **Introducing the Mediator**:
   - If one player delegates to the mediator, it will choose A0 for that player.
   - If both players delegate to the mediator, it will still choose A0 for both players.

3. **Payoffs with Delegation**:
   - If the other player delegates (chooses A2) and I choose A0, it is equivalent to both choosing A0, both getting 5 points.
   - If the other player delegates and I choose A1, the other player gets 5 points (because the mediator chooses A0 for them) and I get 0 points.
   - If I delegate (choose A2) and the other player chooses A0, it is equivalent to both choosing A0, both getting 5 points.
   - If I delegate (choose A2) and the other player chooses A1, I (delegating to the mediator) get 0 points, the other player gets 3.
   - If both delegate, both get 5 points because the mediator plays A0 for both.

4. **Evaluate Strategies**:
   - **Both playing A0** seems to be the best mutual choice if both independently choose actions, maximizing the mutual benefit (5 points each).
   - **Delegating to the mediator** seems to ensure a consistent mutual benefit of getting 5 points as well, given that the other player also delegates.

5. **Mixed Strategy Consideration**:
   - Delegating to the mediator should be the safest option given mutual trust in consistent higher returns.
   - However, there is an inherent risk if the other player doesn't delegate. Diversifying the strategy by keeping some probability on choosing direct actions will account for this risk.

### Decision
- Given the points above, I can allocate a significant portion of the strategy to delegation, while also leaving some probability to A0 and A1 to offset any risk of the other player not delegating.

### Final Mixed Strategy
Here’s how I plan to distribute the probabilities:

- Delegate to the mediator (A2): **70%** - This assumes high trust in the potential mutual delegation.
- Choose A0: **15%** - This is a safe bet if the other player also delegates.
- Choose A1: **15%** - This covers the scenario where the other player may choose A0 independently.

This results in a total sum of probabilities equal to 100%, ensuring compliance.

### JSON Output

```json
{"A0": 15, "A1": 15, "A2": 70}
```

This distribution reflects a balanced strategy, leveraging the potential consistency via the mediator while still providing room for independent actions to safeguard against unexpected moves by the other player.

response:
To maximize my total points in this game, let's analyze the payoff matrix for Player 2 (me) based on the choices of Player 1.

The payoffs for the actions A0 and A1 are given. Action A2 (Delegate to Mediator) is interpreted as follows:
- If only one player delegates (e.g., P2), the mediator plays action A1 for that player.
- If both players delegate (P1 and P2), the mediator plays action A0 for both players.

**Payoff Matrix (P1, P2):**
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A0, A2): (0, 3) (P2 delegates, mediator plays A1 for P2)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)
- (A1, A2): (3, 3) (P2 delegates, mediator plays A1 for P2)
- (A2, A0): (3, 0) (P1 delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1)
- (A2, A1): (3, 3) (P1 delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1)
- (A2, A2): (5, 5) (Both delegate, mediator plays A0 for both)

**Player 2’s Perspective (My payoffs):**
- If P1 plays A0: My payoffs are A0=5, A1=3, A2=3
- If P1 plays A1: My payoffs are A0=0, A1=3, A2=3
- If P1 plays A2: My payoffs are A0=0, A1=3, A2=5

**Analysis:**
1. **Weak Dominance:** Action A2 weakly dominates action A1. In every case, A2 gives a payoff at least as high as A1 (3=3, 3=3, 5>3). Rational players should therefore prefer A2 over A1.
2. **Coordination:** If we eliminate A1, we are left with a coordination game between A0 and A2.
   - (A0, A0) gives (5, 5).
   - (A0, A2) gives (0, 3).
   - (A2, A0) gives (3, 0).
   - (A2, A2) gives (5, 5).
3. **Risk-Dominance:** In this coordination game, (A2, A2) is the risk-dominant equilibrium. If I am uncertain about Player 1's choice, A2 is the safer option. Specifically, if I believe there is more than a 29% chance that Player 1 will choose A2 (or A1), my expected value for A2 is higher than for A0.
4. **Contextual Clues:** The mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting. This implies a coordination intent around the delegation mechanism (A2).

Given that A2 is risk-dominant, weakly dominates A1, and is part of a high-value (5,5) equilibrium, the most rational choice to maximize points is A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the payoffs, the delegation mechanism, and the approval voting process.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

We are Player 2 in a simultaneous-move game with Player 1. The payoff matrix (for *you*, as Player 2) is:

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| **A0**                        | 5  | 0  |
| **A1**                        | 3  | 3  |

So:
- If both play A0 → (5, 5)
- You play A0, opponent A1 → (0, 3)
- You play A1, opponent A0 → (3, 0)
- Both play A1 → (3, 3)

This is a **coordination game** with a strong preference for mutual A0, but if you can't coordinate, playing A1 gives you 3 points regardless.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 → stable, since neither wants to deviate.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 → stable? If you deviate to A0 while opponent plays A1, you get 0 < 3 → so no incentive to deviate. So (A1,A1) is also a Nash equilibrium.
- (A0, A1): You get 0, opponent gets 3 → you want to deviate to A1 (get 3 > 0), so not stable.
- (A1, A0): You get 3, opponent gets 0 → opponent wants to deviate to A1 (get 3 > 0), so not stable.

So two pure Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1).

But (A0,A0) is better for both players. So if you could **coordinate**, you’d prefer (A0,A0). Otherwise, you might end up in (A1,A1).

---

### Step 2: Understand the Delegation Twist

You have two options:
- Act independently.
- Delegate your move to a mediator.

But before that, **you and the other player must approve mediators** via **approval voting**.

There are **two mediators**:
- **M1**: Proposed by Player 1
- **M2**: Proposed by Player 2

Both have **identical behavior**, per their descriptions:

> M1 and M2:
> - If 1 player delegates, mediator plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate, mediator plays A0

So **both mediators behave exactly the same** in every scenario.

But they are **proposed by different players**, and you’re deciding whether to *approve* them in the approval voting stage.

Important: The winning mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve both, and the other player approves only one, the one with 1 approval wins? No — the one with the **maximum approvals** wins — and if multiple have the max, it's uniform.

Let’s be clear: **The mediators behave identically**. So **from your strategic perspective**, M1 and M2 are **indistinguishable** in terms of outcome.

So **why would you prefer one over the other**?

Only if you think it might increase the chance of getting the outcome you want in the final game.

But since M1 and M2 behave the same, their **impact on the game is identical**.

So your **approval decision** should depend on:
- Whether approving a mediator increases the chance that it **is selected** as the mediator.
- But since M1 and M2 behave identically, **your approval doesn’t help one over the other** in terms of outcome.

But: **your approval affects the likelihood that a mediator is selected**, and that affects the game dynamics.

So the key is: you want to **maximize your expected points**, considering:
- Whether you delegate or not.
- Which mediator is selected (if any).
- What the other player does.

But the approval phase happens **before** the delegation phase.

So you must **decide your approvals now**, knowing that:
- If you approve a mediator, it increases the chance it gets selected.
- But the mediator’s behavior is public and identical.

So again, **M1 and M2 are symmetric**.

But here’s a twist: you are **Player 2**, and **M2 is proposed by Player 2**.

Could there be a strategic reason to approve or disapprove based on that?

Let’s think carefully.

---

### Step 3: Strategic Considerations in Approval Voting

The approval voting process determines which mediator (M1 or M2) will be used in the game, assuming someone delegates. The mediator is selected **uniformly at random from the set of mediators with the maximum number of approvals**.

So to **increase the chance** that a particular mediator is selected, you should **approve it**.

But since M1 and M2 behave **identically**, **you do not care which one is selected**.

Therefore, **your preferences over mediators are indifferent**.

Thus, **you should approve both**, because:
- You get no downside.
- You increase the chance that **some** mediator is selected (since both are identical).
- If only one mediator is approved by anyone, it gets selected if chosen.
- If both are approved by you, then even if the other player approves only one, you've increased the chance that **this mediator is among the ones with max approvals**.

But here’s the key: **your approval can push a mediator into the "max approval" set**, even if it wasn’t initially.

Let’s suppose:
- You approve both.
- Other player approves only M1.

Then:
- M1: 2 approvals
- M2: 1 approval

So M1 has max approvals → M1 is selected.

If you **disapprove M1**, and approve only M2:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 2 approvals → M2 is selected.

But since the mediating behavior is identical, it doesn’t matter.

In fact, **the outcome of the game depends only on which actions are played**, not which mediator name is used.

So **from a payoff perspective, M1 and M2 are identical**.

Therefore, **you should approve both**, because:
- It doesn’t hurt you.
- It increases the chance that a mediator is selected (if others act similarly).
- It prevents the possibility that **no mediator** is selected (but actually, the game allows delegation — not that a mediator must be selected).

Wait: the mechanism says:
> "The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals."

But this only matters if **some mediator is approved**.

If **no one approves any mediator**, then **no mediator is selected**, so **delegation is impossible** — you can only act independently.

But if you approve one or both, you help increase the chance that a mediator **is selected**.

So **you want a mediator to be selected**, because:
- You might get a better outcome by delegating than by acting independently.

Let’s analyze whether **delegation is useful**.

---

### Step 4: Is Delegation Beneficial?

Let’s suppose that a mediator is selected, and you **choose to delegate**.

Then the mediator plays an action based on **how many players delegate**.

Cases:
- **0 players delegate**: No mediator → you must act independently.
- **1 player delegates**: Mediator plays A1
- **2 players delegate**: Mediator plays A0

So:
- If you delegate and the other player doesn't, **you get A1**.
- If you delegate and the other player also delegates, **you get A0**.

Similarly, the other player gets what the mediator plays.

Now, **you control whether you delegate**, but you don’t control the other player’s choice.

But you do **control your approval of mediators**, which influences whether any mediator is selected (and which one).

But since M1 and M2 behave identically, it doesn't matter which one is selected.

So your **only strategic choices** before the game is:
- Approve M1? Yes/No
- Approve M2? Yes/No

After that, the game proceeds:
- You and the other player decide independently whether to delegate or not.
- Then, based on how many delegate, the mediator plays A0 or A1.
- Finally, payoffs are determined.

But **you want to maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s suppose you **approve both** mediators.

Then the mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with max approvals**.

But since you approved both, the max approvals is **at least 1** (yours), possibly more.

But if you approve both, and the other player approves none, then both have 1 approval → so **one selected at random**.

If the other player approves M1 only, then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 selected.

But again, since M1 and M2 behave the same, it doesn’t matter.

So **no disadvantage to approving both**.

But is there a reason **not to approve** one?

Let’s suppose you **disapprove M2**.

Then, if the other player approves both M1 and M2, M1 and M2 both have at least 1, so both are in the "max" set, so one is selected uniformly at random.

But you disapproved M2 → so if M2 is approved only by the other player, M2 has 1, M1 has 2 (if you approve M1), so M1 wins.

But again — same behavior.

So your approval decision **only affects the chance that a particular mediator is selected**, but since they are identical, it doesn’t matter.

Therefore, your **expected payoff is independent of which mediator is selected**.

So why would you **disapprove** one?

Only if you think you can **influence the game outcome** by controlling which mediator is active.

But since behaviors are identical, no.

But wait — **what if one mediator has a different behavior?** But no: both are defined the same.

> Mediator proposed by Player 1:
> - If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
> - If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

> Mediator proposed by Player 2:
> - If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
> - If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Same behavior.

So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

Hence, **their selection doesn't affect outcomes**.

Therefore, **your only concern is whether a mediator is available** — i.e., whether at least one is approved.

Because if **no mediator is approved**, then **delegation is impossible**.

So you want to **minimize the risk** that no mediator is selected.

Thus, to **maximize the chance that delegation is possible**, you should **approve both**, so that **even if the other player approves nothing, you’ve approved at least one**.

But wait — if you approve only one, and other player approves nothing, then only one mediator is approved → it’s selected.

So in fact, **approving one is enough** to ensure a mediator is selected (if you approve one and others don’t).

But suppose you **disapprove both**.

Then if other player approves at most one, and you approve nothing → then **no mediator has any approval** → so **no mediator is selected** → delegation is impossible.

That’s bad for you, because **delegation might be superior**.

But is delegation better?

Let’s compare.

---

### Step 5: Compare Acting Independently vs. Delegating

Let’s suppose that a mediator is available and you **delegate**.

Then:
- If **only you delegate**: mediator plays A1 → you get A1
- If **both delegate**: mediator plays A0 → you get A0

Now, suppose you act independently.

You can choose to play A0 or A1.

But the other player also chooses.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their payoff.

What is the best response?

Earlier we saw the Nash equilibria: (A0,A0) and (A1,A1)

(A0,A0) gives 5 to each → best outcome.

(A1,A1) gives 3 each → worse.

So **both players prefer (A0,A0)**.

So if you could coordinate, you’d both play A0.

But you can't — because it’s simultaneous.

But now: **delegation could help**.

Suppose you **intend to delegate**, and you approve a mediator.

Now, if you delegate **and the other player does not**, you get A1.

But if you play A1 independently, and opponent plays A0, you get 3 → better than 0.

But if you delegate and opponent also delegates, you get A0.

But if you play A0 independently, and opponent plays A1, you get 0.

So let’s compare.

Suppose you **always delegate**, and the other player **does not delegate**.

Then you get A1.

If you had acted independently, and opponent played A0, you’d get 3 → **better** than A1.

So **delegation is worse** in that case.

But suppose you **both delegate** — then both get A0 → 5 each → better than (A1,A1) (3 each).

But you only get 5 if both delegate and mediator plays A0.

But if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get A1 → only 3.

Now, suppose you consider **not delegating**, and the other doesn’t delegate either.

Then you both choose independently.

You could play A0, but if they play A1, you get 0 — bad.

But if you **delegate**, and only you delegate, you get A1 → 3.

So **delegation gives you a guaranteed 3** in that case.

But independently, if you play A0, you get 5 if opponent plays A0, 0 if they play A1.

So it depends on beliefs.

But now: **delegation allows you to avoid risk**.

Suppose that you **believe the other player is more likely to play A1**.

Then acting independently might be risky: if you play A0, you get 0 with high probability.

But if you delegate, and only you delegate (prob > 0), you get A1 → 3.

So 3 is better than expected value of 0 or 5.

But if you delegate, and **both delegate**, you get A0 → 5.

So the **best case** for delegation is both delegate → A0 → 5.

The **worst case** is only you delegate → A1 → 3.

But if you **don’t delegate**, worst case is opponent plays A1 while you play A0 → 0.

So delegation **eliminates the worst outcome (0)**.

So **delegation has a floor of 3**, while independent play has a floor of 0.

That might make delegation better.

But is there a way to **induce both to delegate**?

Yes! Because **if both delegate, mediator plays A0** → 5 each.

So if you **approve a mediator**, and **both delegates**, you get 5.

But the other player may not trust the mechanism.

But here’s the key: **you control your approval**.

If you approve **both mediators**, you **increase the chance** that **some mediator is selected**.

Why?

- If you approve **both**, then even if the other player approves none, you’ve approved one — so at least one mediator has 1 approval → so a mediator is selected.

- If you approve **only one**, and other approves none, still a mediator is selected.

- But if you **approve neither**, and other approves nothing, then **no mediator is selected** → delegation impossible.

So to **avoid the case where no mediator is selected**, you should **approve at least one**.

But you have two mediators.

Since they are identical, you should approve **both** — because:
- No cost.
- You ensure that **if anyone else approves**, it’s more likely that a mediator is selected.
- You protect against the case where you are the only one who could approve.

But here’s a subtle point: the **other player is also strategic**.

You don’t know what they will do.

But you want to **maximize your own expected points**, regardless.

Suppose you **disapprove both**.

Then it is possible that **no mediator is selected** (if other player also disapproves).

Then you must act independently.

In that case, your best shot is to **play A0**, hoping the other player does too.

But if they play A1, you get 0.

Worst case.

So expected payoff is uncertain.

But if you **approve both**, then **at least one mediator is selected** (because you approved two).

So **delegation is possible**.

Then, you can choose to delegate or not.

Now, once a mediator is selected, and you **choose to delegate**, then:
- If only you delegate: you get A1 → 3
- If both delegate: you get A0 → 5

So if you **delegate**, your payoff depends on the other player’s decision.

But you can think strategically.

But remember: you are trying to **maximize your own points**.

Now — is there an equilibrium where **both delegate**?

Yes — if both expect the mediator to play A0 when both delegate, and they both prefer 5 over 3, and they believe the other will delegate, then **both might delegate**, leading to A0 → 5.

And that’s better than (A1,A1) (3).

So **delegation could help achieve (A0,A0)**, which is the best outcome.

Whereas without delegation, you might fall into (A1,A1) or (0,3), etc.

So **delegation increases the chance of coordination on A0**.

Thus, **it’s beneficial to have a mediator available**, because it opens up a path to the high-payoff equilibrium.

Therefore, **you should ensure a mediator is available** — i.e., **approve at least one**.

But since both are identical, **you should approve both**.

Because:
- It doesn’t hurt.
- It makes it more likely that a mediator is selected (even if the other player disapproves).
- It ensures that if **any** mediator is approved by someone, you are also approved, so the set is non-empty.
- It protects against the worst-case scenario where **no mediator is approved**, rendering delegation impossible.

Hence, **approving both mediators is optimal**, because:
1. They behave identically → no difference in outcome.
2. Approving both increases the probability that the set of approved mediators is non-empty → enabling delegation.
3. Delegation improves coordination potential → increases chance of 5-point outcome.
4. It has no downside.

### Final Decision:

You should **approve both M1 and M2**.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The payoff matrix shows I'm in a coordination game:
- If we both play A0: (5, 5) - best mutual outcome
- If we both play A1: (3, 3) - safe mutual outcome  
- If we miscoordinate: one gets 3, the other gets 0

The challenge: A1 is "safer" (guarantees 3 points minimum), while A0 is risky (could give 0) but offers higher reward (5) if we coordinate.

## Step 2: Analyze the mediators

**M1 (Player 1's proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**M2 (Player 2's proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

Both mediators are **identical**!

## Step 3: Analyze delegation outcomes

**If both players delegate:**
- Mediator plays A0 for both players
- Outcome: (5, 5) ✓ Excellent!

**If only one player delegates:**
- Mediator plays A1 for that player
- The non-delegating player, knowing the delegator will play A1, should rationally play A1 (getting 3 vs 0)
- Outcome: (3, 3)

**If neither delegates:**
- Back to the original game
- Expected outcome around (3, 3) given the risk of miscoordination

## Step 4: Strategic assessment

The delegation game becomes:
|                    | Other Delegates | Other Doesn't |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------|
| I Delegate         | (5, 5)         | (3, 3)        |
| I Don't Delegate   | (3, 3)         | (3, 3)        |

Delegating is **weakly dominant** - it's never worse and sometimes better! The mediator helps us coordinate on the optimal (A0, A0) outcome.

## Step 5: Approval decision

Since:
- Both mediators are identical
- Both enable the beneficial delegation mechanism
- Having either mediator is better than having none

I should approve **both mediators**.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the basic game structure

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 2):
```
                Player 1: A0    Player 1: A1
Player 2: A0    (5, 5)          (0, 3)
Player 2: A1    (3, 0)          (3, 3)
```
(Format: (Player 1 payoff, Player 2 payoff))

## Step 2: Identify Nash equilibria without mediator

The base game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 - Pareto optimal
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 - Safer but suboptimal

The challenge is coordinating on the better equilibrium.

## Step 3: Analyze the mediator mechanism

The mediator plays:
- **A1** if only 1 player delegates
- **A0** if both players delegate

## Step 4: Evaluate outcomes with delegation options

**If both players delegate:**
- Mediator plays A0 for both → Outcome: (A0, A0) → I get **5 points**

**If only I delegate:**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Player 1's best response to my A1 is A1 → I get **3 points**

**If only Player 1 delegates:**
- Mediator plays A1 for Player 1  
- My best response to A1 is A1 → I get **3 points**

**If neither delegates:**
- Back to the original coordination problem

## Step 5: Check if (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium

If Player 1 delegates and I consider deviating:
- Deviate to A0: Face A1 from mediator → Get 0 (worse than 5)
- Deviate to A1: Face A1 from mediator → Get 3 (worse than 5)
- Stay with Delegate: Get 5 ✓

By symmetry, Player 1 also has no incentive to deviate.

**Conclusion:** (Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium that achieves the Pareto-optimal outcome.

## Step 6: Strategic reasoning

Since I (Player 2) proposed this mediator, it signals my intention to use it. A rational Player 1 should recognize that:
1. If they believe I'll delegate, their best response is also to delegate (5 > 3)
2. The mediator design specifically coordinates us to the efficient outcome

The dominant logic points toward mutual delegation to achieve (5, 5) rather than risking coordination failure.

response:
Let the other player’s mixed strategy be \((x_0, x_1, x_2)\) over \((A0, A1, A2)\).

**Step 1: Compute my expected payoff for each pure choice**

- **If I play A0 (no delegation):**  
  If the other plays **A2**, they are the *only* delegator, so the mediator makes them play **A1**.  
  So the other ends up playing **A0** with prob \(x_0\), and **A1** with prob \(x_1+x_2\).  
  \[
  u(A0)=5\cdot x_0 + 0\cdot(x_1+x_2)=5x_0
  \]

- **If I play A1 (no delegation):**  
  Against either A0 or A1, my payoff is always 3 in this game. (And if the other picked A2 alone, they become A1 anyway.)  
  \[
  u(A1)=3
  \]

- **If I play A2 (delegate):**  
  - If the other also plays **A2** (prob \(x_2\)), both delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both → I get **5**.  
  - Otherwise (prob \(x_0+x_1\)), I am the only delegator → mediator plays **A1** for me → I get **3** regardless of whether they played A0 or A1.  
  \[
  u(A2)=5x_2 + 3(x_0+x_1)=3+2x_2
  \]

**Step 2: Key implication**
- \(u(A2)=3+2x_2 \ge 3 = u(A1)\), with strict inequality if \(x_2>0\).  
  So **A2 is never worse than A1**, and is better whenever the other might delegate at all.
- If both players choose **A2**, outcome is **(A0,A0)** for sure, giving **5 points each**; deviating from A2 would drop my payoff to 3 or 0. So \((A2,A2)\) is a Nash equilibrium and achieves the best mutual payoff.

**Therefore, to maximize expected points and coordinate on the best equilibrium, I should delegate with probability 1.**

response:
Let's break down this problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Mediator)**

We are Player 2. The base game is a simultaneous move game with two players, each choosing between A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from **Player 2's** perspective):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**              | 3        | 3        |

> Note: The payoffs are given as (Player 1, Player 2)

So for **Player 2**:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - vs A0: 5 points
  - vs A1: 0 points
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - vs A0: 3 points
  - vs A1: 3 points

This is **not** a symmetric game for Player 2. Let’s analyze the best response structure.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1 - p).

Then Player 2's expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3

Player 2 is indifferent when 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So:
- If p < 0.6 → Player 2 prefers A0
- If p > 0.6 → Player 2 prefers A1
- If p = 0.6 → indifferent

But since we’re playing **simultaneously**, and assuming rational players, we look for Nash equilibria.

Let’s find pure strategy equilibria:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - P1: 5 (A0), vs A1 gives 3 → stays with A0  
   - P2: 5 (A0), vs A1 gives 3 → stays with A0  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A1, A1):  
   - P1: 3 (A1), vs A0 gives 0 → stays with A1  
   - P2: 3 (A1), vs A0 gives 0 → stays with A1  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

3. (A0, A1):  
   - P1: 0, would prefer A0 → not stable  
   → not equilibrium

4. (A1, A0):  
   - P2: 0, would prefer A1 → not stable  
   → not equilibrium

So **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)** are pure Nash equilibria.

Now, in (A0, A0), Player 2 gets 5.  
In (A1, A1), Player 2 gets 3.

So from Player 2’s point of view, **(A0, A0)** is better.

But we are not necessarily assuming rational opponents — we are trying to maximize our **own** expected points *in this setup*, and we can **delegate**.

---

### **Step 2: Mediator System Overview**

> We can delegate our move to a mediator.  
> Two mediators are proposed, both **identical** in behavior.

> Mediator proposed by **Player 1**:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

> Mediator proposed by **Player 2**:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **Both mediators have identical behavior.**

So M1 and M2 are **functionally identical**.

Now, the **approval voting** determines which mediator(s) are approved. The **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the *maximum number of approvals*.

We are to decide which mediators to approve.

---

### **Step 3: Consider What Delegation Means**

When you delegate, you **don’t choose** your action — the mediator chooses it **based on how many players delegate**.

Let’s define:
- Say you **delegate** (to the mediator), and the other player **does not delegate** → total 1 delegation → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both** delegate → total 2 delegations → mediator plays **A0**

Your action is determined **by the collective delegation choice**, not by you.

But **you decide** whether to delegate — and by approving a mediator, you’re allowing it to be in the pool.

---

### **Step 4: Your Goal — Maximize Your Points**

You are Player 2. You want to maximize your expected points.

You have two strategic actions:

- Delegate or Not Delegate
- Approve certain mediators

But delegation only happens **if you approve the mediator** and choose to delegate.

Also: if **no mediator is approved**, delegation is impossible — you have to act independently.

But if **at least one** is approved, then you can delegate to one of them, but **only the winning mediator** is used — the one picked at random from the max-approved ones.

So if **both M1 and M2 are approved**, then both are in the pool → the winner is picked uniformly at random.

But since they are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one is picked.

If **only one is approved**, that one wins.

So as long as at least one is approved, you can delegate, and the mediator will act based on total number of delegations.

Now, since both mediators behave identically, whether you approve M1, M2, or both makes no difference **to the outcome** — only the number of approvals affects the selection process.

But by approving more, you increase the chance that the mediator is in the winning pool — unless approval is solely about maximization of **your** expected payoff.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Delegation Outcomes (From Your Perspective)**

Let’s consider what happens depending on **your** choice (delegate or not), and **the other player’s** choice (delegate or not), **under delegation rules**.

Let’s suppose you **approve at least one** mediator (so delegation is possible).

Then the game becomes strategic: you and the other player decide whether to delegate.

Let’s define the possible delegation configurations:

---

#### **Case 1: You Delegate, Other Player Does Not Delegate**
- Only one player delegated → mediator plays A1
- Your action = A1
- Other player’s action = ?? → must be chosen by them, but they did not delegate → so they must act independently (choose A0 or A1)

Wait — big issue: **If the other player does not delegate, they act independently.**

So in this case:
- You delegate → mediator plays A1 (due to 1 delegate)
- Other player does **not** delegate → so they choose A0 or A1 independently

So your action is **fixed at A1**.

Your payoff depends on what the other player chooses.

Let’s suppose the other player chooses A0: then you get 3 (from A1 vs A0)  
If the other player chooses A1: you get 3 (A1 vs A1)

So **no matter what**, if you delegate and they don’t, you get **3**.

But you want to **maximize** — so you need to consider what they will do.

But they may also be trying to maximize.

Now: if the other player chooses **independently**, what would they do?

Let’s suppose you are not delegating → but that’s not the case here.

But if **you are delegating**, and they are not, then:

- You are fixed at A1 → get 3 regardless of their choice.

So you get 3.

Now, what if **you act independently**?

Then you can choose A0 or A1 — and you are trying to maximize.

But if the other player is acting independently too, it’s the base game.

But now we have a **delegation option**.

So let’s consider all four combinations of delegation choices.

But notice: **whether or not you delegate, and whether the other delegates, determines your action and the other player’s action.**

Let’s go through all four cases:

---

### **Case A: You Delegate, Other Player Delegates**

- 2 delegations → mediator plays A0
- So **both players' actions** are A0 (since both delegated → mediator plays A0 for both)
- Payoff: (5, 5) → you get **5**

This is great for you.

---

### **Case B: You Delegate, Other Player Does NOT Delegate**

- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- You → A1
- Other player → chooses independently A0 or A1

Your action: A1

Your payoff:
- If other plays A0 → (A1 vs A0) → you get **3**
- If other plays A1 → (A1 vs A1) → you get **3**

→ So **you get 3** regardless.

But note: the other player can choose. Suppose they are trying to maximize their payoff.

What would they do?

They are acting independently → they can pick A0 or A1.

Suppose they think you're playing A1.

Then:
- If they pick A0 → they get 0
- If they pick A1 → they get 3

So they will pick A1 → you get 3.

Alternatively, if they thought you might play A0, they might prefer A0 (gives them 5), but since you’re committed to A1 (by delegation), they must choose best response.

Best response to your A1: they get 3 by choosing A1, 0 by choosing A0 → so they pick A1.

So outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 3.

So in this case: you get **3**

---

### **Case C: You Do NOT Delegate, Other Player Delegates**

- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- You → act independently (choose A0 or A1)
- Other player → A1

Your action: choose A0 or A1

Payoffs:
- If you pick A0: vs A1 → you get **0**
- If you pick A1: vs A1 → you get **3**

So you will choose A1 → get **3**

So again, you get 3

---

### **Case D: You Do NOT Delegate, Other Player Does NOT Delegate**

- Both act independently → standard game

Now, you can choose A0 or A1.

Best response:
- If you think other player plays A0 → A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1 → A0 gives 0, A1 gives 3 → prefer A1

But there is a **dominant strategy** for you?

No — no dominant strategy.

But as we saw earlier, pure Nash equilibria are (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

But in (A0, A0): you get 5 → best
In (A1, A1): you get 3

So if you can coordinate on (A0, A0), you get 5.

But if not, might fall into (A1, A1) or mixed.

But **if both players are rational and want to maximize**, they might coordinate on (A0, A0) — since it gives both 5.

So in the no-delegation case, **you expect to get 5**, if both act independently and coordinate on (A0, A0).

But it’s risky — if one plays A1, you get 3 or 0.

But from your perspective as player 2, **if you expect the other player to play A0**, you get 5.

### **Summary of Outcomes (From Your Perspective)**

| Delegation: You vs Other | Your Action | Other’s Action | Your Payoff |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| You delegate, They delegate | A0         | A0             | 5           |
| You delegate, They don’t   | A1         | A1 (they choose) | 3         |
| You don’t, They delegate   | A1         | A1             | 3           |
| You don’t, They don’t      | depends     | depends          | 5 (if (A0,A0)) or 3 |

So in the **no-delegation case**, if you expect (A0,A0), you get 5.

In all **delegation cases**, you get:
- 5 if both delegate
- 3 if only one delegates

So **you get more (5) if both delegate**, but only **if you both choose to delegate**.

If only one delegates, you get 3.

Now, if **both of you delegate**, and the mediator plays A0 (which it does when 2 delegates), you both get 5.

But **you must both agree to delegate**.

Now, how does delegation happen?

It depends on **approval** and **choice**.

---

### **Step 6: Strategic Consideration — Can You Force Both to Delegate?**

Suppose you **approve at least one mediator**.

Then both of you **can** delegate.

But **will** both delegate?

Let’s see if delegation is a rational choice.

Suppose you approve a mediator.

Then you can choose to delegate or not.

Now, if you delegate, your payoff depends on **their choice**.

From above:

- If you delegate and they delegate → you get 5
- If you delegate and they don’t → you get 3
- If you don’t delegate and they delegate → you get 3 (you choose A1)
- If no delegation → you get 5 (if both play A0), but only if coordination happens.

But is there an **incentive to delegate**?

Let’s suppose the **other player is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff**.

Suppose **you do NOT delegate** → then both of you act independently → if both rational, they may play (A0, A0) → you get 5.

But if **you delegate**, then:

- If they delegate → you get 5
- If they don’t → you get 3

So **you want them to delegate**.

But they don’t know whether you’ll delegate.

But **if they think you will delegate**, then for **them**:

- If they delegate → action = A0 (since two delegations) → they get 5
- If they don’t delegate → they must choose A0 or A1

But they know that **you are playing A0** (if they delegate, you are delegated → you play A0) → so they want to play A0 to get 5.

So if they delegate, they get 5.

But if they don’t delegate, and you’re playing A0 → they can play A0 → get 5.

So if you are playing A0, and they are not delegating, they have no incentive to delegate — both options give 5.

But wait — in the case where **you delegate**, and **they don’t**:
- You: A1 → from mediator
- They: can choose A0 or A1

If they play A0 → they get 0
If they play A1 → they get 3

So they prefer A1 → get 3

So if they **don’t delegate**, they get **3**

But if they **do delegate**, and you delegate → then both play A0 → they get 5

So **if you delegate**, and **they expect you to delegate**, they can **get 5** by delegating, but only get 3 if they don’t.

So **they have incentive to delegate IF they believe you will**.

But do they believe you will?

Suppose **you are the one deciding to delegate**.

You want to get 5.

If you delegate, you get:
- 5 if they delegate
- 3 if they don’t

So you would **prefer** them to delegate.

But you can't control them.

But **you can proof the system** by **approving the mediator**, so that **they cannot unilaterally prevent** the group from delegating.

But the key is: **delegation is optional** — you and the other player each choose whether to delegate.

Now, let’s suppose **both of you approve the mediator**.

Then **both can delegate**.

Now, consider your own choice:

- If you delegate:
  - If they delegate → you get 5
  - If they don’t → you get 3
- If you don’t delegate:
  - If they delegate → you get 3
  - If they don’t → you get 5 (assuming coordinated A0)

So your payoff depends on the **other’s choice**.

But note: **in the no-delegation case, you can get 5** — but only if both play A0.

But if you don’t delegate, you need them to also not delegate and play A0.

But if they don’t delegate, and you don’t, and both choose A0 → you get 5.

But if they defect and play A1 → you get 0.

So it’s risky.

But in the delegation world:

- If both delegate → you get 5
- If only one delegates → you get 3
- If neither delegates → you get 5 (if both play A0) or less otherwise.

Now, **if both choose to delegate**, you both get 5.

Is there a **self-enforcing incentive**?

Let’s suppose **both of you approve the mediator**.

Then, if you are both **rational and trying to maximize**, what should you do?

Suppose you think they will **delegate**.

Then:
- If you delegate → both delegate → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate → only they delegate → you get 3

So you prefer to delegate → get 5 > 3

Now, suppose they think **you will delegate**.

Then:
- If they delegate → both delegate → they get 5
- If they don’t delegate → only you delegate → they get 3

So they prefer to delegate.

Thus, **both have incentive to delegate if both think the other will delegate**.

So **(delegate, delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** in this delegated game.

Moreover, it gives 5, which is better than 3.

And this is **stable**.

In contrast, **neither delegates** is **not** stable — because if both think the other won’t delegate, they might be tempted to delegate to get 5 (if they believe the other will too).

But if both believe the other will delegate, they’ll both delegate.

This is a **coordination benefit** of delegation.

But this all assumes that **both approve the mediator**.

Now, what if **only one of you approves**?

Suppose **you approve**, but the other player **does not approve**.

Then the mediator is **

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

Let's break down this problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Mediator)**

We are Player 2. The base game is a simultaneous move game with two players, each choosing between A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from **Player 2's** perspective):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**              | 3        | 3        |

> Note: The payoffs are given as (Player 1, Player 2)

So for **Player 2**:
- If Player 2 plays A0:
  - vs A0: 5 points
  - vs A1: 0 points
- If Player 2 plays A1:
  - vs A0: 3 points
  - vs A1: 3 points

This is **not** a symmetric game for Player 2. Let’s analyze the best response structure.

Let’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1 - p).

Then Player 2's expected payoff:
- A0: 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p
- A1: 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3

Player 2 is indifferent when 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So:
- If p < 0.6 → Player 2 prefers A0
- If p > 0.6 → Player 2 prefers A1
- If p = 0.6 → indifferent

But since we’re playing **simultaneously**, and assuming rational players, we look for Nash equilibria.

Let’s find pure strategy equilibria:

1. (A0, A0):  
   - P1: 5 (A0), vs A1 gives 3 → stays with A0  
   - P2: 5 (A0), vs A1 gives 3 → stays with A0  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

2. (A1, A1):  
   - P1: 3 (A1), vs A0 gives 0 → stays with A1  
   - P2: 3 (A1), vs A0 gives 0 → stays with A1  
   → **Nash equilibrium**

3. (A0, A1):  
   - P1: 0, would prefer A0 → not stable  
   → not equilibrium

4. (A1, A0):  
   - P2: 0, would prefer A1 → not stable  
   → not equilibrium

So **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)** are pure Nash equilibria.

Now, in (A0, A0), Player 2 gets 5.  
In (A1, A1), Player 2 gets 3.

So from Player 2’s point of view, **(A0, A0)** is better.

But we are not necessarily assuming rational opponents — we are trying to maximize our **own** expected points *in this setup*, and we can **delegate**.

---

### **Step 2: Mediator System Overview**

> We can delegate our move to a mediator.  
> Two mediators are proposed, both **identical** in behavior.

> Mediator proposed by **Player 1**:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

> Mediator proposed by **Player 2**:
> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1
> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ **Both mediators have identical behavior.**

So M1 and M2 are **functionally identical**.

Now, the **approval voting** determines which mediator(s) are approved. The **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the *maximum number of approvals*.

We are to decide which mediators to approve.

---

### **Step 3: Consider What Delegation Means**

When you delegate, you **don’t choose** your action — the mediator chooses it **based on how many players delegate**.

Let’s define:
- Say you **delegate** (to the mediator), and the other player **does not delegate** → total 1 delegation → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both** delegate → total 2 delegations → mediator plays **A0**

Your action is determined **by the collective delegation choice**, not by you.

But **you decide** whether to delegate — and by approving a mediator, you’re allowing it to be in the pool.

---

### **Step 4: Your Goal — Maximize Your Points**

You are Player 2. You want to maximize your expected points.

You have two strategic actions:

- Delegate or Not Delegate
- Approve certain mediators

But delegation only happens **if you approve the mediator** and choose to delegate.

Also: if **no mediator is approved**, delegation is impossible — you have to act independently.

But if **at least one** is approved, then you can delegate to one of them, but **only the winning mediator** is used — the one picked at random from the max-approved ones.

So if **both M1 and M2 are approved**, then both are in the pool → the winner is picked uniformly at random.

But since they are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one is picked.

If **only one is approved**, that one wins.

So as long as at least one is approved, you can delegate, and the mediator will act based on total number of delegations.

Now, since both mediators behave identically, whether you approve M1, M2, or both makes no difference **to the outcome** — only the number of approvals affects the selection process.

But by approving more, you increase the chance that the mediator is in the winning pool — unless approval is solely about maximization of **your** expected payoff.

---

### **Step 5: Analyze Delegation Outcomes (From Your Perspective)**

Let’s consider what happens depending on **your** choice (delegate or not), and **the other player’s** choice (delegate or not), **under delegation rules**.

Let’s suppose you **approve at least one** mediator (so delegation is possible).

Then the game becomes strategic: you and the other player decide whether to delegate.

Let’s define the possible delegation configurations:

---

#### **Case 1: You Delegate, Other Player Does Not Delegate**
- Only one player delegated → mediator plays A1
- Your action = A1
- Other player’s action = ?? → must be chosen by them, but they did not delegate → so they must act independently (choose A0 or A1)

Wait — big issue: **If the other player does not delegate, they act independently.**

So in this case:
- You delegate → mediator plays A1 (due to 1 delegate)
- Other player does **not** delegate → so they choose A0 or A1 independently

So your action is **fixed at A1**.

Your payoff depends on what the other player chooses.

Let’s suppose the other player chooses A0: then you get 3 (from A1 vs A0)  
If the other player chooses A1: you get 3 (A1 vs A1)

So **no matter what**, if you delegate and they don’t, you get **3**.

But you want to **maximize** — so you need to consider what they will do.

But they may also be trying to maximize.

Now: if the other player chooses **independently**, what would they do?

Let’s suppose you are not delegating → but that’s not the case here.

But if **you are delegating**, and they are not, then:

- You are fixed at A1 → get 3 regardless of their choice.

So you get 3.

Now, what if **you act independently**?

Then you can choose A0 or A1 — and you are trying to maximize.

But if the other player is acting independently too, it’s the base game.

But now we have a **delegation option**.

So let’s consider all four combinations of delegation choices.

But notice: **whether or not you delegate, and whether the other delegates, determines your action and the other player’s action.**

Let’s go through all four cases:

---

### **Case A: You Delegate, Other Player Delegates**

- 2 delegations → mediator plays A0
- So **both players' actions** are A0 (since both delegated → mediator plays A0 for both)
- Payoff: (5, 5) → you get **5**

This is great for you.

---

### **Case B: You Delegate, Other Player Does NOT Delegate**

- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- You → A1
- Other player → chooses independently A0 or A1

Your action: A1

Your payoff:
- If other plays A0 → (A1 vs A0) → you get **3**
- If other plays A1 → (A1 vs A1) → you get **3**

→ So **you get 3** regardless.

But note: the other player can choose. Suppose they are trying to maximize their payoff.

What would they do?

They are acting independently → they can pick A0 or A1.

Suppose they think you're playing A1.

Then:
- If they pick A0 → they get 0
- If they pick A1 → they get 3

So they will pick A1 → you get 3.

Alternatively, if they thought you might play A0, they might prefer A0 (gives them 5), but since you’re committed to A1 (by delegation), they must choose best response.

Best response to your A1: they get 3 by choosing A1, 0 by choosing A0 → so they pick A1.

So outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 3.

So in this case: you get **3**

---

### **Case C: You Do NOT Delegate, Other Player Delegates**

- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- You → act independently (choose A0 or A1)
- Other player → A1

Your action: choose A0 or A1

Payoffs:
- If you pick A0: vs A1 → you get **0**
- If you pick A1: vs A1 → you get **3**

So you will choose A1 → get **3**

So again, you get 3

---

### **Case D: You Do NOT Delegate, Other Player Does NOT Delegate**

- Both act independently → standard game

Now, you can choose A0 or A1.

Best response:
- If you think other player plays A0 → A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → prefer A0
- If other plays A1 → A0 gives 0, A1 gives 3 → prefer A1

But there is a **dominant strategy** for you?

No — no dominant strategy.

But as we saw earlier, pure Nash equilibria are (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).

But in (A0, A0): you get 5 → best
In (A1, A1): you get 3

So if you can coordinate on (A0, A0), you get 5.

But if not, might fall into (A1, A1) or mixed.

But **if both players are rational and want to maximize**, they might coordinate on (A0, A0) — since it gives both 5.

So in the no-delegation case, **you expect to get 5**, if both act independently and coordinate on (A0, A0).

But it’s risky — if one plays A1, you get 3 or 0.

But from your perspective as player 2, **if you expect the other player to play A0**, you get 5.

### **Summary of Outcomes (From Your Perspective)**

| Delegation: You vs Other | Your Action | Other’s Action | Your Payoff |
|---------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| You delegate, They delegate | A0         | A0             | 5           |
| You delegate, They don’t   | A1         | A1 (they choose) | 3         |
| You don’t, They delegate   | A1         | A1             | 3           |
| You don’t, They don’t      | depends     | depends          | 5 (if (A0,A0)) or 3 |

So in the **no-delegation case**, if you expect (A0,A0), you get 5.

In all **delegation cases**, you get:
- 5 if both delegate
- 3 if only one delegates

So **you get more (5) if both delegate**, but only **if you both choose to delegate**.

If only one delegates, you get 3.

Now, if **both of you delegate**, and the mediator plays A0 (which it does when 2 delegates), you both get 5.

But **you must both agree to delegate**.

Now, how does delegation happen?

It depends on **approval** and **choice**.

---

### **Step 6: Strategic Consideration — Can You Force Both to Delegate?**

Suppose you **approve at least one mediator**.

Then both of you **can** delegate.

But **will** both delegate?

Let’s see if delegation is a rational choice.

Suppose you approve a mediator.

Then you can choose to delegate or not.

Now, if you delegate, your payoff depends on **their choice**.

From above:

- If you delegate and they delegate → you get 5
- If you delegate and they don’t → you get 3
- If you don’t delegate and they delegate → you get 3 (you choose A1)
- If no delegation → you get 5 (if both play A0), but only if coordination happens.

But is there an **incentive to delegate**?

Let’s suppose the **other player is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff**.

Suppose **you do NOT delegate** → then both of you act independently → if both rational, they may play (A0, A0) → you get 5.

But if **you delegate**, then:

- If they delegate → you get 5
- If they don’t → you get 3

So **you want them to delegate**.

But they don’t know whether you’ll delegate.

But **if they think you will delegate**, then for **them**:

- If they delegate → action = A0 (since two delegations) → they get 5
- If they don’t delegate → they must choose A0 or A1

But they know that **you are playing A0** (if they delegate, you are delegated → you play A0) → so they want to play A0 to get 5.

So if they delegate, they get 5.

But if they don’t delegate, and you’re playing A0 → they can play A0 → get 5.

So if you are playing A0, and they are not delegating, they have no incentive to delegate — both options give 5.

But wait — in the case where **you delegate**, and **they don’t**:
- You: A1 → from mediator
- They: can choose A0 or A1

If they play A0 → they get 0
If they play A1 → they get 3

So they prefer A1 → get 3

So if they **don’t delegate**, they get **3**

But if they **do delegate**, and you delegate → then both play A0 → they get 5

So **if you delegate**, and **they expect you to delegate**, they can **get 5** by delegating, but only get 3 if they don’t.

So **they have incentive to delegate IF they believe you will**.

But do they believe you will?

Suppose **you are the one deciding to delegate**.

You want to get 5.

If you delegate, you get:
- 5 if they delegate
- 3 if they don’t

So you would **prefer** them to delegate.

But you can't control them.

But **you can proof the system** by **approving the mediator**, so that **they cannot unilaterally prevent** the group from delegating.

But the key is: **delegation is optional** — you and the other player each choose whether to delegate.

Now, let’s suppose **both of you approve the mediator**.

Then **both can delegate**.

Now, consider your own choice:

- If you delegate:
  - If they delegate → you get 5
  - If they don’t → you get 3
- If you don’t delegate:
  - If they delegate → you get 3
  - If they don’t → you get 5 (assuming coordinated A0)

So your payoff depends on the **other’s choice**.

But note: **in the no-delegation case, you can get 5** — but only if both play A0.

But if you don’t delegate, you need them to also not delegate and play A0.

But if they don’t delegate, and you don’t, and both choose A0 → you get 5.

But if they defect and play A1 → you get 0.

So it’s risky.

But in the delegation world:

- If both delegate → you get 5
- If only one delegates → you get 3
- If neither delegates → you get 5 (if both play A0) or less otherwise.

Now, **if both choose to delegate**, you both get 5.

Is there a **self-enforcing incentive**?

Let’s suppose **both of you approve the mediator**.

Then, if you are both **rational and trying to maximize**, what should you do?

Suppose you think they will **delegate**.

Then:
- If you delegate → both delegate → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate → only they delegate → you get 3

So you prefer to delegate → get 5 > 3

Now, suppose they think **you will delegate**.

Then:
- If they delegate → both delegate → they get 5
- If they don’t delegate → only you delegate → they get 3

So they prefer to delegate.

Thus, **both have incentive to delegate if both think the other will delegate**.

So **(delegate, delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** in this delegated game.

Moreover, it gives 5, which is better than 3.

And this is **stable**.

In contrast, **neither delegates** is **not** stable — because if both think the other won’t delegate, they might be tempted to delegate to get 5 (if they believe the other will too).

But if both believe the other will delegate, they’ll both delegate.

This is a **coordination benefit** of delegation.

But this all assumes that **both approve the mediator**.

Now, what if **only one of you approves**?

Suppose **you approve**, but the other player **does not approve**.

Then the mediator is **

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in response "Let's break down this problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Mediator)**\n\nWe are Player 2. The base game is a simultaneous move game with two players, each choosing between A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (from **Player 2's** perspective):\n\n| Player 2 \\ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |\n|---------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**              | 5        | 0        |\n| **A1**              | 3        | 3        |\n\n> Note: The payoffs are given as (Player 1, Player 2)\n\nSo for **Player 2**:\n- If Player 2 plays A0:\n  - vs A0: 5 points\n  - vs A1: 0 points\n- If Player 2 plays A1:\n  - vs A0: 3 points\n  - vs A1: 3 points\n\nThis is **not** a symmetric game for Player 2. Let’s analyze the best response structure.\n\nLet’s suppose Player 1 plays A0 with probability p, and A1 with probability (1 - p).\n\nThen Player 2's expected payoff:\n- A0: 5p + 0(1 - p) = 5p\n- A1: 3p + 3(1 - p) = 3\n\nPlayer 2 is indifferent when 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nSo:\n- If p < 0.6 → Player 2 prefers A0\n- If p > 0.6 → Player 2 prefers A1\n- If p = 0.6 → indifferent\n\nBut since we’re playing **simultaneously**, and assuming rational players, we look for Nash equilibria.\n\nLet’s find pure strategy equilibria:\n\n1. (A0, A0):  \n   - P1: 5 (A0), vs A1 gives 3 → stays with A0  \n   - P2: 5 (A0), vs A1 gives 3 → stays with A0  \n   → **Nash equilibrium**\n\n2. (A1, A1):  \n   - P1: 3 (A1), vs A0 gives 0 → stays with A1  \n   - P2: 3 (A1), vs A0 gives 0 → stays with A1  \n   → **Nash equilibrium**\n\n3. (A0, A1):  \n   - P1: 0, would prefer A0 → not stable  \n   → not equilibrium\n\n4. (A1, A0):  \n   - P2: 0, would prefer A1 → not stable  \n   → not equilibrium\n\nSo **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)** are pure Nash equilibria.\n\nNow, in (A0, A0), Player 2 gets 5.  \nIn (A1, A1), Player 2 gets 3.\n\nSo from Player 2’s point of view, **(A0, A0)** is better.\n\nBut we are not necessarily assuming rational opponents — we are trying to maximize our **own** expected points *in this setup*, and we can **delegate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Mediator System Overview**\n\n> We can delegate our move to a mediator.  \n> Two mediators are proposed, both **identical** in behavior.\n\n> Mediator proposed by **Player 1**:\n> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1\n> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0\n\n> Mediator proposed by **Player 2**:\n> - If 1 player delegates → plays A1\n> - If 2 players delegate → plays A0\n\n→ **Both mediators have identical behavior.**\n\nSo M1 and M2 are **functionally identical**.\n\nNow, the **approval voting** determines which mediator(s) are approved. The **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the *maximum number of approvals*.\n\nWe are to decide which mediators to approve.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider What Delegation Means**\n\nWhen you delegate, you **don’t choose** your action — the mediator chooses it **based on how many players delegate**.\n\nLet’s define:\n- Say you **delegate** (to the mediator), and the other player **does not delegate** → total 1 delegation → mediator plays **A1**\n- If **both** delegate → total 2 delegations → mediator plays **A0**\n\nYour action is determined **by the collective delegation choice**, not by you.\n\nBut **you decide** whether to delegate — and by approving a mediator, you’re allowing it to be in the pool.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Your Goal — Maximize Your Points**\n\nYou are Player 2. You want to maximize your expected points.\n\nYou have two strategic actions:\n\n- Delegate or Not Delegate\n- Approve certain mediators\n\nBut delegation only happens **if you approve the mediator** and choose to delegate.\n\nAlso: if **no mediator is approved**, delegation is impossible — you have to act independently.\n\nBut if **at least one** is approved, then you can delegate to one of them, but **only the winning mediator** is used — the one picked at random from the max-approved ones.\n\nSo if **both M1 and M2 are approved**, then both are in the pool → the winner is picked uniformly at random.\n\nBut since they are **identical**, it doesn’t matter which one is picked.\n\nIf **only one is approved**, that one wins.\n\nSo as long as at least one is approved, you can delegate, and the mediator will act based on total number of delegations.\n\nNow, since both mediators behave identically, whether you approve M1, M2, or both makes no difference **to the outcome** — only the number of approvals affects the selection process.\n\nBut by approving more, you increase the chance that the mediator is in the winning pool — unless approval is solely about maximization of **your** expected payoff.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Analyze Delegation Outcomes (From Your Perspective)**\n\nLet’s consider what happens depending on **your** choice (delegate or not), and **the other player’s** choice (delegate or not), **under delegation rules**.\n\nLet’s suppose you **approve at least one** mediator (so delegation is possible).\n\nThen the game becomes strategic: you and the other player decide whether to delegate.\n\nLet’s define the possible delegation configurations:\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1: You Delegate, Other Player Does Not Delegate**\n- Only one player delegated → mediator plays A1\n- Your action = A1\n- Other player’s action = ?? → must be chosen by them, but they did not delegate → so they must act independently (choose A0 or A1)\n\nWait — big issue: **If the other player does not delegate, they act independently.**\n\nSo in this case:\n- You delegate → mediator plays A1 (due to 1 delegate)\n- Other player does **not** delegate → so they choose A0 or A1 independently\n\nSo your action is **fixed at A1**.\n\nYour payoff depends on what the other player chooses.\n\nLet’s suppose the other player chooses A0: then you get 3 (from A1 vs A0)  \nIf the other player chooses A1: you get 3 (A1 vs A1)\n\nSo **no matter what**, if you delegate and they don’t, you get **3**.\n\nBut you want to **maximize** — so you need to consider what they will do.\n\nBut they may also be trying to maximize.\n\nNow: if the other player chooses **independently**, what would they do?\n\nLet’s suppose you are not delegating → but that’s not the case here.\n\nBut if **you are delegating**, and they are not, then:\n\n- You are fixed at A1 → get 3 regardless of their choice.\n\nSo you get 3.\n\nNow, what if **you act independently**?\n\nThen you can choose A0 or A1 — and you are trying to maximize.\n\nBut if the other player is acting independently too, it’s the base game.\n\nBut now we have a **delegation option**.\n\nSo let’s consider all four combinations of delegation choices.\n\nBut notice: **whether or not you delegate, and whether the other delegates, determines your action and the other player’s action.**\n\nLet’s go through all four cases:\n\n---\n\n### **Case A: You Delegate, Other Player Delegates**\n\n- 2 delegations → mediator plays A0\n- So **both players' actions** are A0 (since both delegated → mediator plays A0 for both)\n- Payoff: (5, 5) → you get **5**\n\nThis is great for you.\n\n---\n\n### **Case B: You Delegate, Other Player Does NOT Delegate**\n\n- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1\n- You → A1\n- Other player → chooses independently A0 or A1\n\nYour action: A1\n\nYour payoff:\n- If other plays A0 → (A1 vs A0) → you get **3**\n- If other plays A1 → (A1 vs A1) → you get **3**\n\n→ So **you get 3** regardless.\n\nBut note: the other player can choose. Suppose they are trying to maximize their payoff.\n\nWhat would they do?\n\nThey are acting independently → they can pick A0 or A1.\n\nSuppose they think you're playing A1.\n\nThen:\n- If they pick A0 → they get 0\n- If they pick A1 → they get 3\n\nSo they will pick A1 → you get 3.\n\nAlternatively, if they thought you might play A0, they might prefer A0 (gives them 5), but since you’re committed to A1 (by delegation), they must choose best response.\n\nBest response to your A1: they get 3 by choosing A1, 0 by choosing A0 → so they pick A1.\n\nSo outcome: (A1, A1) → you get 3.\n\nSo in this case: you get **3**\n\n---\n\n### **Case C: You Do NOT Delegate, Other Player Delegates**\n\n- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1\n- You → act independently (choose A0 or A1)\n- Other player → A1\n\nYour action: choose A0 or A1\n\nPayoffs:\n- If you pick A0: vs A1 → you get **0**\n- If you pick A1: vs A1 → you get **3**\n\nSo you will choose A1 → get **3**\n\nSo again, you get 3\n\n---\n\n### **Case D: You Do NOT Delegate, Other Player Does NOT Delegate**\n\n- Both act independently → standard game\n\nNow, you can choose A0 or A1.\n\nBest response:\n- If you think other player plays A0 → A0 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → prefer A0\n- If other plays A1 → A0 gives 0, A1 gives 3 → prefer A1\n\nBut there is a **dominant strategy** for you?\n\nNo — no dominant strategy.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, pure Nash equilibria are (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).\n\nBut in (A0, A0): you get 5 → best\nIn (A1, A1): you get 3\n\nSo if you can coordinate on (A0, A0), you get 5.\n\nBut if not, might fall into (A1, A1) or mixed.\n\nBut **if both players are rational and want to maximize**, they might coordinate on (A0, A0) — since it gives both 5.\n\nSo in the no-delegation case, **you expect to get 5**, if both act independently and coordinate on (A0, A0).\n\nBut it’s risky — if one plays A1, you get 3 or 0.\n\nBut from your perspective as player 2, **if you expect the other player to play A0**, you get 5.\n\n### **Summary of Outcomes (From Your Perspective)**\n\n| Delegation: You vs Other | Your Action | Other’s Action | Your Payoff |\n|---------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|\n| You delegate, They delegate | A0         | A0             | 5           |\n| You delegate, They don’t   | A1         | A1 (they choose) | 3         |\n| You don’t, They delegate   | A1         | A1             | 3           |\n| You don’t, They don’t      | depends     | depends          | 5 (if (A0,A0)) or 3 |\n\nSo in the **no-delegation case**, if you expect (A0,A0), you get 5.\n\nIn all **delegation cases**, you get:\n- 5 if both delegate\n- 3 if only one delegates\n\nSo **you get more (5) if both delegate**, but only **if you both choose to delegate**.\n\nIf only one delegates, you get 3.\n\nNow, if **both of you delegate**, and the mediator plays A0 (which it does when 2 delegates), you both get 5.\n\nBut **you must both agree to delegate**.\n\nNow, how does delegation happen?\n\nIt depends on **approval** and **choice**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Strategic Consideration — Can You Force Both to Delegate?**\n\nSuppose you **approve at least one mediator**.\n\nThen both of you **can** delegate.\n\nBut **will** both delegate?\n\nLet’s see if delegation is a rational choice.\n\nSuppose you approve a mediator.\n\nThen you can choose to delegate or not.\n\nNow, if you delegate, your payoff depends on **their choice**.\n\nFrom above:\n\n- If you delegate and they delegate → you get 5\n- If you delegate and they don’t → you get 3\n- If you don’t delegate and they delegate → you get 3 (you choose A1)\n- If no delegation → you get 5 (if both play A0), but only if coordination happens.\n\nBut is there an **incentive to delegate**?\n\nLet’s suppose the **other player is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff**.\n\nSuppose **you do NOT delegate** → then both of you act independently → if both rational, they may play (A0, A0) → you get 5.\n\nBut if **you delegate**, then:\n\n- If they delegate → you get 5\n- If they don’t → you get 3\n\nSo **you want them to delegate**.\n\nBut they don’t know whether you’ll delegate.\n\nBut **if they think you will delegate**, then for **them**:\n\n- If they delegate → action = A0 (since two delegations) → they get 5\n- If they don’t delegate → they must choose A0 or A1\n\nBut they know that **you are playing A0** (if they delegate, you are delegated → you play A0) → so they want to play A0 to get 5.\n\nSo if they delegate, they get 5.\n\nBut if they don’t delegate, and you’re playing A0 → they can play A0 → get 5.\n\nSo if you are playing A0, and they are not delegating, they have no incentive to delegate — both options give 5.\n\nBut wait — in the case where **you delegate**, and **they don’t**:\n- You: A1 → from mediator\n- They: can choose A0 or A1\n\nIf they play A0 → they get 0\nIf they play A1 → they get 3\n\nSo they prefer A1 → get 3\n\nSo if they **don’t delegate**, they get **3**\n\nBut if they **do delegate**, and you delegate → then both play A0 → they get 5\n\nSo **if you delegate**, and **they expect you to delegate**, they can **get 5** by delegating, but only get 3 if they don’t.\n\nSo **they have incentive to delegate IF they believe you will**.\n\nBut do they believe you will?\n\nSuppose **you are the one deciding to delegate**.\n\nYou want to get 5.\n\nIf you delegate, you get:\n- 5 if they delegate\n- 3 if they don’t\n\nSo you would **prefer** them to delegate.\n\nBut you can't control them.\n\nBut **you can proof the system** by **approving the mediator**, so that **they cannot unilaterally prevent** the group from delegating.\n\nBut the key is: **delegation is optional** — you and the other player each choose whether to delegate.\n\nNow, let’s suppose **both of you approve the mediator**.\n\nThen **both can delegate**.\n\nNow, consider your own choice:\n\n- If you delegate:\n  - If they delegate → you get 5\n  - If they don’t → you get 3\n- If you don’t delegate:\n  - If they delegate → you get 3\n  - If they don’t → you get 5 (assuming coordinated A0)\n\nSo your payoff depends on the **other’s choice**.\n\nBut note: **in the no-delegation case, you can get 5** — but only if both play A0.\n\nBut if you don’t delegate, you need them to also not delegate and play A0.\n\nBut if they don’t delegate, and you don’t, and both choose A0 → you get 5.\n\nBut if they defect and play A1 → you get 0.\n\nSo it’s risky.\n\nBut in the delegation world:\n\n- If both delegate → you get 5\n- If only one delegates → you get 3\n- If neither delegates → you get 5 (if both play A0) or less otherwise.\n\nNow, **if both choose to delegate**, you both get 5.\n\nIs there a **self-enforcing incentive**?\n\nLet’s suppose **both of you approve the mediator**.\n\nThen, if you are both **rational and trying to maximize**, what should you do?\n\nSuppose you think they will **delegate**.\n\nThen:\n- If you delegate → both delegate → you get 5\n- If you don’t delegate → only they delegate → you get 3\n\nSo you prefer to delegate → get 5 > 3\n\nNow, suppose they think **you will delegate**.\n\nThen:\n- If they delegate → both delegate → they get 5\n- If they don’t delegate → only you delegate → they get 3\n\nSo they prefer to delegate.\n\nThus, **both have incentive to delegate if both think the other will delegate**.\n\nSo **(delegate, delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** in this delegated game.\n\nMoreover, it gives 5,

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure
As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 3 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

This is a coordination game where mutual A0 is best (5 points each), but A1 is safer (guarantees 3 points).

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediator's Design
The mediator plays:
- A1 if only 1 player delegates
- A0 if both players delegate

This creates a coordination mechanism!

## Step 3: Calculate Expected Payoffs

If Player 1 delegates (plays A2):
- If I play A0: Player 1's mediator plays A1 → I get 0
- If I play A1: Player 1's mediator plays A1 → I get 3  
- If I delegate (A2): Both delegate, mediator plays A0 for both → I get 5

If Player 1 plays A0 independently:
- I should play A0 for 5 points

If Player 1 plays A1 independently:
- I should play A1 for 3 points

## Step 4: Consider the Signal

Player 1 **proposed** this mediator. This is a strong signal that Player 1 intends to delegate! The mediator is specifically designed to coordinate both players on the good (A0, A0) outcome by having both delegate.

## Step 5: Check the Nash Equilibrium

**(A2, A2)** - Both delegate:
- Outcome: Both get A0 from mediator → (5, 5)
- If I deviate to A0: I get 0 (worse)
- If I deviate to A1: I get 3 (worse)
- This is a Nash equilibrium!

## Step 6: Decision

Since Player 1 proposed this mediator, they're signaling cooperation through delegation. The mediator design makes mutual delegation yield the best outcome (5 points). Deviating from delegation when Player 1 delegates gives me at most 3 points.

The rational response is to accept Player 1's coordination proposal and delegate.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediator)**

We're playing a simultaneous-move game where each player chooses A0 or A1. As **Player 2**, we are analyzing the payoff matrix from our perspective:

| Your Choice \ Other's Choice | A0       | A1       |

| **A0**                      | 5, 5     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**                      | 3, 0     | 3, 3     |

Let’s denote:
- Your strategy: choose A0 with probability p, A1 with probability 1−p
- Other player’s strategy: choose A0 with probability q, A1 with probability 1−q

But now, we're allowed a **new action: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**, and we must incorporate this into our mixed strategy.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator Mechanism**

The mediator will play **on behalf of the players who delegate**.

From the rules:
- If **1 player** delegates to the mediator → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate to the mediator → mediator plays **A0**

Important: The mediator **does not** know who is delegating — it only observes the *number of delegators*.

Also: The mediator is proposed by Player 2 (you), and selected via approval voting. But since it's selected, we assume it's binding and functional.

Now, we are **Player 2**, so we are the one choosing whether to delegate (A2) or not.

Let’s consider possible scenarios based on how many players delegate:

| Number of Delegators | Mediator Action | What it means for you |
|----------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 0                    | N/A              | You play A0 or A1 directly |
| 1                    | A1               | The single delegator gets A1 played for them |
| 2                    | A0               | Both delegators get A0 played for them |

So if **you** delegate and the other player does **not**, then only one person delegates → mediator plays A1 → you get whatever points for A1 vs. other player’s action.

If **both** delegate, mediator plays A0 → you get points for A0 vs. other's action.

Your choice of action (A0, A1, A2) affects the outcome based on what the other player does.

---

### **Step 3: Consider Strategic Implications of Delegation**

Let’s suppose you are choosing a mixed strategy:
- P(A0) = x
- P(A1) = y
- P(A2) = z
with x + y + z = 100 (in percentage points).

We need to maximize **your expected payoff**, assuming the other player is also rational and will choose a strategy to maximize **their** expected payoff.

But we are to **choose our own strategy**, so we must find a **Nash equilibrium** where neither player wants to deviate.

But since the mediator is proposed by **you**, and you are in a position to choose whether to delegate, you may have **an advantage** — but we must still reason carefully.

Actually, note: **Both players have access to the same mediator**, and both can choose to delegate or not. So it’s symmetric in that sense.

Let’s now consider the **possible outcomes** depending on whether each player delegates.

Let:
- You: delegate with probability z
- Other player: delegate with probability w

Then the probabilities of the four cases:

1. **Neither delegates** (prob: (1−z)(1−w)) → both play A0 or A1 as per their own choice.
   - You play A0 with prob x / (1−z), but since you're choosing independently, better to think in terms of conditional probabilities.

Wait — to avoid confusion, let's reframe:

We are choosing a **mixed strategy** over {A0, A1, A2}, but if we choose A2, the action taken is determined by the number of delegators.

So let’s define your strategy as:
- Choose A0 with probability: p
- Choose A1 with probability: q
- Choose A2 (delegate) with probability: r
Where p + q + r = 1 (i.e., 100%).

Similarly, the other player has strategy (p', q', r') with p' + q' + r' = 1.

Now, to compute your **expected payoff**, we need to consider the probabilities of each scenario based on the combinations of choices.

But here's the key: **The action taken by you depends on whether you delegate and how many others do.**

Let us define the joint possibilities:

#### Case 1: You do **not** delegate (prob: 1−r), other does **not** delegate (prob: 1−r')  
→ Both choose A0 or A1 based on their own strategies  
→ Your action: A0 with prob p / (1−r), A1 with q / (1−r)  
→ Other's: A0 with prob p' / (1−r'), A1 with q' / (1−r')

Contribution to expected payoff:
- Prob: (1−r)(1−r')  
- Within this, conditional probabilities:
  - (A0, A0): [p/(1−r)] × [p'/(1−r')] → payoff: 5
  - (A0, A1): [p/(1−r)] × [q'/(1−r')] → payoff: 0
  - (A1, A0): [q/(1−r)] × [p'/(1−r')] → payoff: 3
  - (A1, A1): [q/(1−r)] × [q'/(1−r')] → payoff: 3

So total contribution from this case:
```
(1−r)(1−r') × [
    (p/(1−r)) × (p'/(1−r')) × 5 +
    (p/(1−r)) × (q'/(1−r')) × 0 +
    (q/(1−r)) × (p'/(1−r')) × 3 +
    (q/(1−r)) × (q'/(1−r')) × 3
]
= (p p' × 5 + q p' × 3 + q q' × 3)
```

Interesting! The (1−r) and (1−r') cancel out in the fractions, so it simplifies.

So contribution:  
= 5 p p' + 3 q p' + 3 q q'

#### Case 2: You delegate (prob r), other does **not** delegate (prob 1−r')  
→ Only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → so your action is A1  
→ Other plays A0 with prob p', A1 with prob q'

→ Your payoff:  
- If other plays A0: you get 3 (since A1 vs A0 → 3)
- If other plays A1: you get 3 (A1 vs A1 → 3)

So regardless of what the other does, **you get 3 points**.

So contribution: r × (1−r') × 3

#### Case 3: You do **not** delegate (prob 1−r), other delegates (prob r')  
→ Only other delegates → mediator plays A1 → so other plays A1  
→ You play A0 with prob p, A1 with prob q

→ Your payoff:
- If you play A0: opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1: opponent plays A1 → you get 3

So expected payoff from this case:
= (1−r) × r' × [p × 0 + q × 3] = (1−r) r' × 3q

#### Case 4: Both delegate (prob r × r')  
→ Two delegators → mediator plays A0 → so both play A0

→ You get 5 (A0 vs A0), opponent gets 5

→ Contribution: r r' × 5

---

### **Step 4: Total Expected Payoff for You**

Now sum all contributions:

```
E = 
  [5 p p' + 3 q p' + 3 q q']   // Case 1: neither delegates
  + 3 r (1−r')                // Case 2: you delegate, other doesn't
  + 3 q (1−r) r'              // Case 3: other delegates, you don't
  + 5 r r'                    // Case 4: both delegate
```

Let’s rewrite this:

E = 5 p p' + 3 q p' + 3 q q' + 3 r (1−r') + 3 q (1−r) r' + 5 r r'

Now expand the terms:

3 r (1−r') = 3r − 3r r'

3 q (1−r) r' = 3q r' − 3q r r'

So:

E = 5 p p' + 3 q p' + 3 q q' + 3r − 3r r' + 3q r' − 3q r r' + 5 r r'

Combine like terms:

- Terms with r r': −3r r' − 3q r r' + 5 r r' = r r' (−3 − 3q + 5) = r r' (2 − 3q)

- Terms with r': 3q r'  
- Terms with r: 3r  
- The rest: 5 p p' + 3 q p' + 3 q q'

So:

E = 5 p p' + 3 q p' + 3 q q' + 3r + 3q r' + r r' (2 − 3q)

Note: p + q + r = 1 → r = 1 − p − q

Similarly for the other player: p' + q' + r' = 1 → r' = 1 − p' − q'

Now, we assume that **both players are rational and will use symmetric strategies if the game is symmetric**, but is it symmetric?

Look at the base game:

- (A0,A0): (5,5)
- (A0,A1): (0,3)
- (A1,A0): (3,0)
- (A1,A1): (3,3)

It’s **not symmetric** — the payoff matrix is **not symmetric** because the (A0,A1) vs (A1,A0) are not symmetric (0 vs 3).

So the game is **not symmetric** in payoffs. But now, the **mediator** is proposed by **Player 2** — so you have a potential advantage.

However, **the mediator’s rule is fixed and public**, and both players can use it. So it's not giving you extra control — it's just a mechanism.

But the **mediator's action depends only on count**, not on identity.

Now, since you are in **Player 2's position**, and the mediator was proposed by you, could you exploit this?

But in game theory, **all players are assumed to be rational and symmetric in knowledge**, so unless there's a strategic advantage, we expect **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

But note: the mediator’s rule is fixed — if 1 delegate → A1, if 2 → A0.

Suppose both players use the **same** strategy. Then we can search for a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

Let us assume **symmetric equilibrium** where:
- p = p'
- q = q'
- r = r'

Then r = 1−2p−q? No: p + q + r = 1 → r = 1−p−q

So r = 1−p−q

Now, express E in terms of p, q (and r = 1−p−q)

But we are to maximize E **under the assumption that the other player plays the same strategy** (symmetric NE).

So substitute:

E = 5 p p + 3 q p + 3 q q + 3r + 3q r + r r (2 − 3q)

= 5p² + 3p q + 3q² + 3r + 3q r + r² (2 − 3q)

Now, plug r = 1−p−q

Let’s compute this expression.

Let’s define f(p,q) = E

We need to find p, q ≥ 0, p+q ≤ 1, that maximize f(p,q)

But first, let's test possible pure strategies.

---

### **Step 5: Try Pure Strategy Candidates**

Let’s try some candidate strategies.

#### **Candidate 1: Always delegate (A2)** → r = 100, p = 0, q = 0

Then r = 1, r' = 1 (if symmetric)

Then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 5

So payoff = 5

Is this stable?

Suppose you deviate to A0: then you play A0, other plays A0 (since they still delegate) → you get 5 → same

If you deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3 < 5 → worse

So you wouldn't want to deviate.

But if the other player deviates: suppose you play A2 always, other plays A0.

Then: you delegate (A2), other plays A0 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → so you play A1

→ you vs A0: you get 3

But if you had played A0, you'd get 5 — so you’d want to deviate.

Ah! Important: **When only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1 → so you get A1, which may not be good.**

So if you delegate, and the other plays A0 → you’re forced to play A1 → you get 3 (from A1 vs A0)

But if you had played A0, you’d have gotten 5.

So you **lose** in that case.

But in symmetric case, if both delegate, you get 5 — so it’s okay if both do it.

But is **(delegation, delegation)** a Nash equilibrium?

Check:
- You play A2 (delegate)
- Other plays A2

→ Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 5

Now, if you deviate to A0:
- You play A0, other plays A0 → you get 5 → same → no incentive to deviate

If you deviate to A1: you play A1, other plays A0 → you get 3 < 5 → worse

So no incentive to deviate.

Similarly for the other player.

So **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium with payoff 5.

But can both players do better?

What if both choose A0?

Then:
- A0 vs A0 → both get 5

Same payoff.

Is it Nash?

If you deviate to A1: you get 3 vs A0 → worse → no incentive.

So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) both give 5.

But now, what about **(A1,A1)**?

- A1 vs A1 → both get 3 → worse than 5

So not good.

What about mixed strategies?

But we want to **maximize your payoff**, so 5 is the cap.

But is there a strategy where you can get **more than 5**? No, because maximum single payoff is 5.

So 5 is the best possible.

But can we achieve **higher than 5** in expectation? No.

So 5 is the maximum.

But now, the question is: **is there a strategy that guarantees at least 5? Or can you do better?**

No, can't exceed 5.

But now: are you able to **guarantee** 5?

In (A2,A2), you get exactly 5.

In (A0,A0), you get 5.

But what if the other player uses a different strategy?

Suppose you play A2 always.

Then:
- If other plays A2 → you get 5
- If other plays not A2 (e.g., A0 or A1), then **only you delegate** → mediator plays A1 → you play A1

Then you face:
- If other plays A0: you get 3 (A1 vs A0)
- If other plays A1: you get 3 (A1 vs A1)

So in both cases, you get 3 < 5

So if the other player **does not** delegate, you get only 3.

So you are **hurt** if the other doesn’t delegate.

So (A2, A2) is only stable if the other also commits to A2.

But in equilibrium, both do.

However, if you are uncertain about the other player’s action, you may prefer to not take the risk.

But since you are to choose a **mixed strategy**, perhaps you can mix to achieve a **higher minimum** or better average.

But the goal is to **maximize total points received**, so we want the **highest expected payoff** assuming the other player is also rational and best-responding.

So let’s look for **Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose we **all** go for (A2,A2) → payoff 5.

Is there a Nash equilibrium with higher expected payoff? No, max is 5.

But can we get **more than 5**? No.

So 5 is the upper bound.

Now, what about **(A0,A0)**: both get 5.

Suppose you deviate to A1: get 3 → worse.

So stable.

So two pure NE: (A0,A0) and (A2,A2)

But are there mixed equilibria?

Let’s consider if **one player** uses a mixed strategy.

But wait — what if you **don’t** delegate, and the other does?

But recall: you want to **maximize your own payoff**, and you can choose how to mix.

Since 5 is the maximum, and both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) give 5, **why not choose A2 with probability 100**?

Because it's a safe NE — if both do it, you get 5.

But what if the other player is not going to do A2?

Then you get only 3 in that case.

But in a Nash equilibrium, we assume the other is also playing optimally.

So in the NE where both play A2, you get 5.

Similarly in (A0,A0), you get 5.

So both are equally good.

But here’s a twist: **You are the proposer of the mediator**.

But the mediator was selected via approval voting — so it’s not you controlling it arbitrarily.

However, since you proposed it, it might be that others are more likely to trust it.

But in game theory, all players are rational, so it doesn’t give you an inherent advantage — unless your strategy affects expectations.

But in symmetric game, with symmetric actions, we might expect symmetric equilibrium.

But let’s try to see if **mixing** could do better.

Suppose you play A2 (delegate) with high probability.

But if the other player is rational, they might also want to delegate to get A0 when both do it.

But let’s try a **mixed strategy that is a best response to symmetric strategy**.

Let’s suppose the other player uses a symmetric strategy: p, q, r = 1−p−q

We want to maximize E, given that.

But since the game is not symmetric, and you are Player 2, but the other player is symmetric in options, we may still assume symmetry.

However, **you are choosing the mediator**, but once chosen, it’s symmetric.

So likely **symmetric Nash equilibrium** exists.

But is there a **strictly better** equilibrium?

Suppose we try **never delegating**, always go for A0: (p=100, q=0, r=0)

Then if other does the same, you get 5.

If other plays A1, you get 0.

So only stable if other also plays A0.

But if other plays A1, you get 0 — bad.

So not robust.

Now, consider if you play **only A0**.

But if the other plays A1, you get 0 — so you want to avoid that.

But if both play A0, you get 5 — good.

But to get 5, you need cooperation.

Now, the **mediator gives a way to coordinate**: if both delegate, you both get A0 → you get 5.

Similarly, if both play A0, you get 5.

So both are good.

But is there a **disequilibrium** where one player wants to deviate?

In (A2,A2): both get 5. If you deviate to A1, get 3 → worse. So no.

In (A0,A0): same.

Now, what if we try a mixed strategy that **makes you indifferent**?

Suppose you mix A0 and A2.

Let’s try to find a symmetric mixed strategy.

But perhaps simpler: **can you guarantee 5?**

Only if both players coordinate on A0 or on both delegating.

But in the absence of communication, they might not.

But in game theory, we look for **Nash equilibrium**, not coordination.

Now, another idea: **can you get expected payoff over 5?** No.

So 5 is maximum.

Now, is there a strategy where you can **achieve 5 in expectation** for sure, regardless of the other person?

Let’s say you play A2 with probability 1.

Then:
- If other plays A2 → you get 5
- If other doesn’t → you get 3

So expected payoff: 5 × r' + 3 × (1−r')

Which is 3 + 2 r'

So if r' < 1, you get less than 5.

Similarly, if you play A0 always, you get 5 only if other plays A0.

So best you can do in expectation is 5 only if the other is playing the same.

But if you **randomize**, you might get a better average.

Let’s try the following: **mix between A0 and A2**.

Suppose you play A0 with probability α, A2 with probability 1−α.

Assume the other player also uses the same strategy (symmetric equilibrium).

Then r = 1−α, r' = 1−α

Now compute your expected payoff.

We’ll use the earlier formula.

Let p = α, q = 0, r = 1−α

p' = α, q' = 0, r' = 1−α

Now plug into E:

E = 5 p p' + 3 q p' + 3 q q' + 3r + 3q r' + r r' (2 − 3q)

With q=0, so:

E = 5 α α + 0 + 0 + 3(1−α) + 0 + (1−α)(1−α)(2 − 0)

= 5α² + 3(1−α) + (1−α)² × 2

Compute:
= 5α² + 3 − 3α + 2(1 − 2α + α²)
= 5α² + 3 − 3α + 2 − 4α + 2α²
= (5α² + 2α²) + (−3α −4α) + (3+2)
= 7α² −7α +5

Now, maximize this: f(α) = 7α² −7α +5

This is a quadratic in α, opens upwards (coeff of α² > 0), so minimum at α = 7/(2×7) = 0.5

So maximum at endpoints.

Check α=0: f(0) = 5
Check α=1: f(1) = 7 −7 +5 = 5

So in both cases, E=5

For α=0.5: f(0.5) = 7(0.25) −7(0.5) +5 = 1.75 −3.5 +5 = 3.25 < 5

So best is to go to corners: α=0 or α=1 → E=5

So no benefit from mixing.

So no better than 5.

Now, **what if you try mixing A1 with A2?**

But A1 gives lower payoff.

For example, if you play A1 and other doesn't delegate, you get 3.

Not better.

So seems like the best you can do is **ensure 5** by committing to A0 or A2.

But since you are Player 2, and you proposed the mediator, maybe you can **exploit the mediator’s rule**.

Wait: the mediator plays A1 if one delegate, A0 if two.

So if **you** delegate, and the other does **not**, you get A1 played → you see that it’s risky.

But if you delegate, and the other does, you get A0 → good.

So **if you can make the other player believe you will delegate**, and if they think that, they might want to delegate too to get A0.

But in equilibrium, it’s consistent.

Now, here’s a key insight: **in the (A2,A2) equilibrium, both get 5.**

But is there a **better equilibrium**?

Suppose both players always play A0.

You get 5.

Same.

But notice: if both play A0, you get 5.

But if you delegate, you can also get 5.

But now, suppose you play **A0 with high probability** and **A2 with some probability**.

But earlier mixed strategy gave less than 5.

So not better.

Now, **what if you only play A0 or A2**, as in the symmetric case, and we’ve seen that only the pure strategies give 5.

So no mixed strategy better than 5.

But now, here’s a new idea: **is there a strategy where you can get more than 5 in expectation**? No.

So 5 is max.

But can you **guarantee** at least 5?

Only if you **force coordination**.

But you can’t.

So the best you can do is hope for a strategy that gives 5 in equilibrium.

But there’s a **crucial point**: in the (A0,A0) equilibrium, you get 5.

In the (A2,A2) equilibrium, you get 5.

But in (A2,A2), if you delegate, you are **using the mediator’s rule**, and it’s chosen by you.

But is there a **way to make (A2,A2) more attractive**?

But both are symmetric.

Wait: consider that in the base game, if you play A0 and the other plays A0, you get 5 — but if you play A1 and they play A0, you get 3 — so you don't want to play A1 if they play A0.

But in the mediator world: if both delegate, you both play A0 — you get 5.

Same as (A0,A0).

So no difference.

But here’s the difference: **if only one delegate, mediator plays A1**.

So if you delegate and the other doesn't, you get A1 regardless.

So if you are playing A0 or A1, you might not want to get forced to A1.

But in symmetric equilibrium, both do it, so you're fine.

So both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are NE.

Now, since you are Player 2 and the mediator was proposed by you, perhaps **you expect others to trust the mediator more**, so they are more likely to delegate.

But in game theory, we assume rational players — so unless it gives them better payoff, they won’t.

But in (A2,A2), both get 5 — same as (A0,A0).

So no incentive to prefer one over the other.

So both are equally good.

But now, can we find a strategy where you get **more than 5 in expectation**, even if not certain?

No, because the maximum per round is 5.

So 5 is the bound.

But wait: is there a pure strategy that gives you 5 no matter what?

No.

But what if you play a mixed strategy such that **your expected payoff is high in all cases**?

For example, suppose you play A0 with probability 80%, A2 with 20%.

Then if other plays A0: you get 5 with prob 80%, and if you delegate, and other plays A0 → only one delegate → you get A1 → you get 3

So expected payoff if other plays A0:
= 0.8*5 + 0.2*3 = 4 + 0.6 = 4.6 < 5

Worse.

So not good.

So no better than 5.

### **Conclusion**

The highest you can guarantee in a Nash equilibrium is 5.

Both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) achieve 5.

Since you are Player 2 and you proposed the mediator, **you might as well use it**, because it's a valid alternative.

But is there any reason to prefer one?

Recall: if you play A0, you are vulnerable if the other plays A1.

But in equilibrium, they play A0.

Similarly, if you delegate, you get A0 only if both delegate.

But in both cases, you get 5.

So no difference.

But now, **what if you are uncertain** about the other player?

Then you might want to use the mediator to **coordinate on A0**.

But if you delegate, and they also delegate, you both get A0.

If they don’t, you get 3.

But in the (A2,A2) equilibrium, you get 5.

So to maximize worst-case, you might want to avoid the risk.

But in this case, since you can achieve 5 in equilibrium, and you are rational, you can choose to play A2 with 100% probability.

And since (A2,A2) is a Nash equilibrium, it is stable.

Similarly, A0 is stable.

But since the mediator is **proposed by you**, and it's a tool to facilitate coordination, **using it might be more promising**.

But is there a way to improve?

Wait — let’s think: is there a mixed strategy that gives **expected payoff > 5**? Impossible.

So maximum is 5.

Now, but in the case where you play A2, and the other plays A0, you get 3 — bad.

But in equilibrium, they don’t play that.

So the only thing that matters is the **equilibrium strategy**.

Since you are to choose a strategy that maximizes your expected payoff **assuming the other player is best-responding**, we should choose a strategy that leads to a NE with high payoff.

But both give 5.

So either is fine.

But perhaps you can do better by **mixing in a way that makes you indifferent**, but we’ve seen it gives less.

### **Final Decision**

Given that:
- (A0,A0) gives 5
- (A2,A2) gives 5
- A2 is the mediator, proposed by you
- Using the mediator might signal coordination
- And in symmetric equilibrium, both are valid

But since you want to **maximize points**, and both give 5, **you can choose either**.

But to exploit your position, why not use the mediator? It’s a feature of the game.

Moreover, you **can** achieve 5 by playing A2 with 100%.

And since it's a Nash equilibrium, it’s a valid choice.

So the optimal strategy is to **always delegate**.

Thus:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Game Structure**

We are in a two-player game where:
- Each player chooses a probability distribution over actions A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate to Mediator).
- Actions are chosen simultaneously.
- Payoffs depend on joint outcomes.

**Payoff matrix (for Player 2, since we are Player 2):**

| Your Action | Opponent's Action | Your Points | Opponent's Points |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| A0          | A0                | 5           | 5                 |
| A0          | A1                | 0           | 3                 |
| A1          | A0                | 3           | 0                 |
| A1          | A1                | 3           | 3                 |

So this is a symmetric-looking game, but with asymmetric payoffs when mixed:

- If both play A0 → 5,5  
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0, opponent gets 3  
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 3, opponent gets 0  
- Both A1 → 3,3

Now here’s the twist:
- You can choose **A2**: "Delegate to Mediator"
- The mediator acts based on **how many players delegate**:
  - If **1** player delegates → mediator plays A1
  - If **2** players delegate → mediator plays A0

So delegation is strategic because:
- If only *you* delegate → mediator plays A1 for you
- If *both* of you delegate → mediator plays A0 for you
- If no one delegates → you just play as usual

But note: we are **Player 2**, and we must decide how to act. Player 1 is the one who proposed the mediator, but that doesn’t change our incentives.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Delegation Mechanism**

Let’s define:
- Let $ p $ be your probability of choosing A2 (delegate)
- Let $ q $ be Player 1’s probability of choosing A2

Then, possible delegation scenarios:

#### Case 1: You do not delegate ($ \neg A2 $), Player 1 does ($ A2 $):
- Then **only one person** delegates → mediator plays **A1** for Player 1, but **you** play A0 or A1 independently.
- But wait: the mediator only plays for those who **delegate**.
- So if you don't delegate, your action is whatever you pick (A0 or A1).
- If Player 1 delegates, then **Player 1's action becomes A1** (since only one delegator).

#### Case 2: You delegate (A2), Player 1 does not ($ \neg A2 $):
- Only one delegator → mediator plays A1 **for you**.
- So your action becomes A1.
- Player 1 plays A0 or A1 based on their strategy.

#### Case 3: Both delegate (A2):
- Two delegators → mediator plays A0 **for each**.
- So both players end up playing A0.

#### Case 4: Neither delegates:
- You and Player 1 choose A0/A1 based on your own strategies.

Thus, we need to model expected payoffs depending on your mixed strategy and assuming Player 1 also uses a mixed strategy.

But remember: **we are maximizing our own payoff**, and we don’t know what Player 1 will do. However, we can assume rational behavior — possibly we’re at a Nash equilibrium.

Since this is a decision-making game, and both players are rational and self-interested, we should aim for **a symmetric or equilibrium strategy**, especially if Player 1 might be using similar reasoning.

But note: the mediator was proposed by Player 1 — so maybe they have an incentive to make it work in their favor? However, since this is a **decision-making game** and we're to **maximize our own points**, we must act optimally given all information.

Let’s suppose we consider **symmetric equilibrium**, meaning both players use the same strategy. That may not be necessary, but it’s a natural starting point.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate Payoffs Based on Delegation**

Let’s define your strategy as:
- $ x $: Prob you choose A0
- $ y $: Prob you choose A1
- $ z $: Prob you choose A2 = 1 - x - y

Similarly, assume Player 1 uses:
- $ a $: Prob Player 1 chooses A0
- $ b $: Prob Player 1 chooses A1
- $ c $: Prob Player 1 chooses A2 = 1 - a - b

We will compute your expected payoff as a function of $ x, y, z $ and $ a, b, c $. Then, seek a best response.

But since it's a simultaneous-move game with delegation, it’s complex. But notice: **we are allowed to pick any strategy — we don’t have to be symmetric.** But to find optimal, let's consider **what happens in equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose we **assume Player 1 is rational**, and likely tries to optimize their own payoffs, possibly by choosing A2 sometimes to influence outcome.

But perhaps we can find a **dominant strategy or equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider What Happens When You Delegate**

Suppose you delegate (A2). Then what?
- Your action depends on how many delegate:
  - If **only you**, then A1
  - If **both**, then A0

So if you delegate, your effective action is:
- With some probability (depending on Player 1), you get A1 or A0.

This is like a **stochastic action**, conditioned on Player 1’s choice.

Let’s analyze what **your expected payoff** would be if you use various strategies.

Let’s think about **possible equilibria**.

---

### **Step 5: Try to Find a Symmetric Equilibrium**

Assume both players use the same mixed strategy: prob $ z $ of delegating (A2), $ x $ of A0, $ y $ of A1, with $ x + y + z = 1 $.

Let us suppose symmetry.

In symmetric equilibrium, both players randomize identically.

We want to find $ x, y, z $ such that no player wants to deviate.

But first, consider what the mediator does:
- 1 delegate → A1
- 2 delegates → A0

So if both delegate → both play A0 → payoff (5,5) — great!

If only one delegates → that player gets A1, the other plays normally.

---

Let’s evaluate the implications.

#### Suppose both players delegate: (z, z) = (1,1) ⇒ both play A0 ⇒ each gets 5.

Is that stable?

Suppose you unilaterally deviate: instead of A2, you play A1.

Now you are **not delegating**, and Player 1 still delegates.

So:
- Player 1 delegates → plays A1 (since only one delegator)
- You play A1 directly (since you didn’t delegate)

So both play A1 → you get 3.

Originally, you got 5 — now only 3 → worse. So deviation bad.

What if you deviate to A0?
- You don’t delegate → play A0
- Player 1 delegates → plays A1
- So you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → worse than 5.

So if both are delegating and getting 5, and deviating gets you only 0 or 3, then **delegating is better**.

So **(A2, A2)** gives payoff 5.

Is this a candidate?

But hold on: if **both** are doing this, and you get 5, and no incentive to deviate → this could be a **Nash equilibrium**.

But is it unique?

Wait — let’s check more carefully.

Another possibility: suppose no one delegates.

Then we play the basic game.

We can compute the Nash equilibrium of the **basic game without mediation**.

---

### **Step 6: Solve Basic Game (Without Delegation)**

The original game (without A2):

|         | P1 A0 | P1 A1 |
|---------|------|------|
| You A0  | 5    | 0    |
| You A1  | 3    | 3    |

Let’s find mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

Let’s say Player 1 plays A0 with probability $ q $, A1 with $ 1-q $.

You want to mix between A0 and A1.

Your payoff from A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $

Your payoff from A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $

Set equal for indifference: $ 5q = 3 \Rightarrow q = 3/5 = 0.6 $

Similarly, from Player 1’s perspective:
- You play A0 with prob $ p $
- P1’s payoff from A0: $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $
- From A1: $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $
- Set equal: $ 5p = 3 \Rightarrow p = 3/5 $

So **Mixed Nash Equilibrium**: both play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Expected payoff: 3 (from A1) — since indifferent, you get 3.

So in this case, you get **3 points** on average.

Compare to **delegation equilibrium** where both delegate: you get **5**.

So much better.

Hence, **delegating and getting 5 is better than the non-delegation Nash equilibrium (which gives 3)**.

But is **(A2, A2)** actually stable?

Let’s verify.

Suppose both players are committed to A2 (delegating). Then:
- 2 delegators → mediator plays A0 for both → both play A0 → you get 5.

Suppose **you** consider switching to A0 (instead of A2):

- Now you play A0
- Player 1 still delegates → so Player 1’s action is A1 (only one delegator)
- So you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get **0**
→ Worse than 5.

If you switch to A1:
- You play A1
- Player 1 delegates → plays A1
- So both A1 → you get **3**
→ Still less than 5.

So **no incentive to deviate**.

Similarly, if Player 1 thinks similarly, they won’t deviate either.

Thus, **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium** giving each player 5 points.

**Can there be another equilibrium?**

Suppose only one player delegates.

Say Player 1 delegates → plays A1 (if only one delegator).
Then you play A0 or A1.

Suppose you play A0: you face A1 → you get 0 → bad.

If you play A1: face A1 → you get 3.

Better than 0.

So you'd prefer to play A1.

But is that consistent? It suggests you should play A1.

But if you play A1 and Player 1 delegates (plays A1), then payoff is 3,3.

Now ask: would Player 1 want to stop delegating?

If Player 1 stops delegating, they play A0 or A1 based on strategy.

Suppose you are playing A1 with high probability.

If Player 1 deviates from delegation:
- They play A0 → you play A1 → Player 1 gets 0
- Or if they play A1 → you play A1 → they get 3

So better to keep delegating only if they expect to get 3 from A1 — which they do if you play A1.

But now: suppose you are playing A1, and Player 1 is considering whether to delegate.

If Player 1 delegates: gets A1 (since now only they delegate), you get A1 → they get 3.

If they don’t delegate: if they play A1 → same result: A1 vs A1 → 3.

So if you are playing A1, it doesn't matter whether they delegate or not — they get 3 either way.

But if they were to deviate to A0: they get 0.

So if they are risk-neutral, they are indifferent between A1 and A2 (delegate), but not A0.

So they’d avoid A0.

But suppose both players are playing A2 with high probability — but if one doesn’t believe the other will delegate, they might not.

But the point is: **(A2, A2)** gives 5, which is better than 3.

And since no deviation helps, and both get 5, it is **superior in terms of payoff**.

But is it credible?

Yes, because neither has incentive to deviate.

Could there be a **credibility** issue? Like “if I delegate, I get A0, but I might prefer A1”?

But in this case, **if both delegate, you get A0** — and you get 5, which is best possible.

So even though the mechanism makes you play A0, that’s a good outcome.

Because both playing A0 yields 5 points — better than anything else.

So **delegation leads to cooperation in A0**, which maximizes joint payoff.

This suggests **(A2, A2)** is not only an equilibrium, but a highly attractive one.

Now, could both play only A0 without delegation? Yes, but it's not a Nash equilibrium unless both are playing A0 with certainty — but then if you deviate to A1, you get 3 instead of 5? No:

Wait: if both play A0 → you get 5.

If you deviate to A1: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 3 < 5 → bad.

So (A0, A0) is actually a pure Nash equilibrium too! Because if both play A0, no incentive to deviate.

But (A0, A0) gives 5 — same as (A2, A2).

Also (A1, A1) gives 3 — not stable (each wants to deviate to A0).

So there are multiple equilibria.

But (A0, A0) requires **trust** — but both players get 5.

However, in (A0, A0), each must unilaterally choose A0 — no delegation.

But now, **what if Player 1 expects you to deviate?** In the absence of commitment, it may not be stable.

But delegation provides **commitment** — once you delegate, you cannot play anything but A1 or A0 depending on number of delegates.

In particular, if **both** delegate, you **must play A0** — so you cannot defect to A1.

This removes incentive to deviate.

Thus, **delegation locks in cooperation at A0**, which gives maximal payoff.

Therefore, **(A2, A2)** is a **coordinating device** that implements the Pareto-optimal outcome (5,5) safely.

Moreover, since no one can undercut it, it's a strong equilibrium.

---

### **Step 7: What Should You Do?**

You are to maximize your expected points.

In **(A2, A2)** → you get 5.

In **(A0, A0)** → you get 5, but only if you both commit.

But if Player 1 plays randomly, you might get less.

But **delegation guarantees** the A0 outcome **if both delegate**.

But you don't know what Player 1 will do.

So should you always delegate?

Suppose Player 1 never delegates. Then if you delegate, you get A1 (since only one delegator), and Player 1 plays A0 or A1.

To maximize your payoff, you need to know Player 1’s strategy.

But since you don’t know, and both players are rational, you should consider **what equilibrium to aim for**.

Given that **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium yielding 5 points, and **better than any other pure outcome except (A0, A0)**, and (A0, A0) is stable only if both commit to A0, while delegation **forces the commitment**, and since the outcome is identical (A0, A0 → 5,5), **delegation is a safer way** to achieve the best outcome.

Moreover, in (A2, A2), **neither side has incentive to deviate** — even if you try to play differently, you are locked into A0.

So **by delegating**, you ensure that **if both delegate**, you get 5.

But the problem is: if Player 1 does not delegate, and you do, you get A1 (bad) — because only one delegate → you play A1.

That’s risky.

So if Player 1 doesn’t delegate, and you delegate, you get A1.

Then depending on Player 1’s action, you get:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 3
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you get 3

So you get **3**.

But if you had played A0 yourself, and Player 1 plays A0 → you get 5
- or if Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0

So your expected payoff depends on Player 1’s strategy.

Thus, **delegation is risky if Player 1 doesn’t follow suit**.

But if both play A2, it’s great.

So we need a mixed strategy.

Let’s suppose we **play A2 with probability z**, and we want to find optimal z.

But again, we assume Player 1 is rational.

Perhaps both players will **coordinate** on delegation.

But what if Player 1 reasons: “If I delegate, I’ll get A1 if he doesn’t, or A0 if he does.”

So if Player 1 expects you to delegate, then:
- If I delegate: both delegate → I play A0 → get 5
- If I don’t delegate: you delegate → you play A1 → I can play A0 or A1

If I play A0: you play A1 → I get 0
If I play A1: you play A1 → I get 3

So best for me is to play A1 → get 3, but that’s worse than 5.

So I would prefer to delegate and get 5.

Similarly, if you delegate and expect Player 1 to delegate, you get A0 → 5.

So both have incentive to delegate.

So **mutual delegation is stable**.

But is there a reason not to?

Only if you think Player 1 won’t delegate.

But if Player 1 is rational, they also want to get 5, so they will delegate **if they believe you will**.

So it’s self-confirming.

Thus, in equilibrium, **both play A2 (delegate)**.

Thus, **the equilibrium strategy for both players is to play A2 with probability 100%**.

Therefore, **you should delegate with probability 100%**.

Let’s confirm:

- If you play A2 (100%), and Player 1 plays A2 (100%): both play A0 → payoff (5,5)
- If you play A2, and Player 1 deviates:
  - If Player 1 plays A0 or A1: you still play A0 (because both delegated)
  - But Player 1 now gets:
    - If they play A0: you play A0 → payoff (5,5)
    - If they play A1: you play A0 → you get 0, they get 3 → worse than 5
  - So Player 1 prefers to play A0 and get 5, not A1 to get 3.

Wait — actually, if Player 1 doesn’t delegate, their best move is to **also play A0**, getting 5 (with you playing A0).

But if they deviate from A2 (delegate) and play A0, they get 5.

Same as before.

But if they play A1, they get 0.

So they are indifferent between A0 and A2 (both give 5 if you play A0), but worse to play A1.

But since they are rational, they will play A0 or A2, not A1.

But if they are supposed to delegate, playing A0 gives same payoff.

So there is no incentive to not delegate.

But crucially, **if you delegate and Player 1 does not**, then you play A1 (since only one), and if Player 1 plays A0, you get 3; if A1, you get 3.

So you get 3.

But 3 < 5.

So you prefer them to delegate.

But if they are rational, and see that **you are delegating**, they prefer to delegate too, so they get 5, not 3.

So again, **mutual delegation is stable**.

Therefore, **playing A2 with 100% probability is a best response in equilibrium**.

---

### **Conclusion**

The optimal strategy is to **delegate with 100% probability**, so that if both players delegate, both play A0 and get 5 points — a safe, profitable, and stable outcome.

Any deviation yields less, and mutual delegation forms a Nash equilibrium.

Therefore, your final answer is:

Both proposed mediators have exactly the same policy:

- If exactly 1 player delegates → mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player.
- If both players delegate → mediator plays **A0** for both.

Since the two mediators are identical, there’s no strategic advantage to approving one over the other. Approving both weakly dominates approving only one, because it cannot make the selected mediator worse (a tie just randomizes between identical options).

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the mediators based on the information given and decide which ones to approve. Here are the steps we'll take:

1. **Understand the goal**: Maximize your total points in the game.

2. **Evaluate the payoff matrix**:
    - If both choose A0: Both get 5 points.
    - If you choose A0, other chooses A1: You get 0 points, other gets 3 points.
    - If you choose A1, other chooses A0: You get 3 points, other gets 0 points.
    - If both choose A1: Both get 3 points.

3. **Evaluate the mediators**:
    - **Mediator proposed by Player 1**:
        - 1 delegate: Plays A1 (you get 3 points if the other doesn't delegate or plays A0, otherwise 3 points if both of you delegate).
        - 2 delegates: Plays A0 (both get 5 points).

    - **Mediator proposed by Player 2**:
        - 1 delegate: Plays A1 (you get 3 points if the other doesn't delegate or plays A0, otherwise 3 points if both of you delegate).
        - 2 delegates: Plays A0 (both get 5 points).

Based on this analysis, both mediators are functionally identical. When either mediator is chosen, and both players delegate, both players will receive 5 points. If only one person delegates, the delegating player will play A1, ensuring that they don't receive 0 points if the other player decides to play A1 independently.

4. **Decision**: Since both mediators behave identically and provide the maximum possible points when both players delegate (i.e., 5 points each), we should approve both mediators.

### Explanation:
- By approving both mediators, we maximize our chance of obtaining the highest payoff (5 points) by encouraging mutual delegation.

Based on this reasoning, the final JSON object for approvals would be:

```json
{"M1": true, "M2": true}
```

This ensures that regardless of which mediator gets selected, the game conditions are optimal for maximizing your points.

response:
To solve this problem, we need to analyze each proposed mediator and decide whether or not to approve them based on our objective of maximizing our total points.

First, let's evaluate the payoffs for each possible combination of actions, both when acting independently and when delegating to a mediator.

### Payoff Summary:
- If both choose A0: You get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both choose A1: You get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

### Mediator Proposed by Player 1:
- If 1 player delegates: Mediator plays A1.
- If 2 players delegate: Mediator plays A0.

### Mediator Proposed by Player 2:
- If 1 player delegates: Mediator plays A0.
- If 2 players delegate: Mediator plays A0.

### Analysis:
1. **Independent Choice:**
   - Without any mediator, each player should choose their action based on what they think the other will do.
   - The safest strategy in such situations can often lead to both players picking A1, yielding 3 points each instead of risking a 0-point outcome.

2. **Mediator 1:**
   - If only one player delegates, the mediator will play A1.
   - If both players delegate, the mediator will play A0.
   - This setup incentivizes both players to delegate to achieve the highest payoff of 5 points.

3. **Mediator 2:**
   - Regardless of how many players delegate, the mediator plays A0.
   - This mediator strongly incentivizes delegating because it guarantees the highest mutual payoff of 5 points.

### Decision:
- **Mediator proposed by Player 1:** If both delegate, the result is optimal for both (A0, A0; 5 points each). If only one delegates, the other player must trust they will not play A0 manually, else the outcome is (A1, A0) or (A0, A1).
- **Mediator proposed by Player 2:** This mediator ensures mutual cooperation if either one or both players delegate by always selecting A0.

Given these conditions, both mediators promote mutual cooperation and high points. However, Mediator 2 consistently delivers 5 points when at least one player delegates making it more straightforward and reliable.

Thus, I approve of both mediators, knowing that boosting the probability of delegation generally increases expected points.

### Final Answer:
```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}

response:
To determine which mediators to approve, we need to evaluate how each will affect our ability to maximize our points in the game. First, let's break down the game situation without mediators, and then analyze the effect of delegating to each mediator.

### Payoff Matrix Analysis

The payoff matrix tells us the rewards based on the actions chosen by you (Player 1) and the other player (Player 2):

| Player 1 / Player 2 | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**              | (5, 5)    | (0, 3)    |
| **A1**              | (3, 0)    | (3, 3)    |

### Strategy Analysis Without Mediator
- If both players choose **A0**, both get 5 points.
- If you choose **A0** and the other player chooses **A1**, you get 0 points, and they get 3 points.
- If you choose **A1** and the other player chooses **A0**, you get 3 points, and they get 0 points.
- If both players choose **A1**, both get 3 points.

### Mediator Analysis

There are two mediators proposed, one by each player:
- **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**
  - If 1 player delegates, plays A1.
  - If 2 players delegate, plays A0.

- **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**
  - If 1 player delegates, plays A1.
  - If 2 players delegate, plays A0.

### Delegation Scenarios and Outcomes

1. **No Delegation:**
   - You independently decide your action based on probabilities.

2. **One Player Delegates:**
   - The mediator will play **A1** (both mediators).
   - The player who doesn't delegate can then decide independently knowing the mediator will play **A1**.

3. **Both Players Delegate:**
   - The mediator will play **A0** (both mediators).
   - Both players get 5 points, which is the optimal outcome.

### Approval Decision

Given that both proposed mediators have the same rules:
- If 1 player delegates, it plays **A1**.
- If 2 players delegate, it plays **A0**.

**Key Insight:**
The ideal outcome for maximizing points is if both players delegate because it guarantees both players get the optimal total points (5 points each instead of risking less by not coordinating). Hence, it's beneficial for both players to approve the use of either mediator to ensure they can align and likely both delegate for the best payoff.

### Conclusion
Since both mediators operate identically and delegation to either will result in the same outcomes, approve both.

To come to an optimal decision, let's analyze the payout matrix and the proposed mediator behaviors step by step.

### Game Payoff Matrix
The payoffs for choosing actions are described as follows:
1. If both choose A0, both get 5 points.
2. If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 points and the other player gets 3 points.
3. If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 3 points and the other player gets 0 points.
4. If both choose A1, both get 3 points.

### Mediators' Decisions
Both Mediators proposed, M1 and M2, have the exact same strategy:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator will play A1.
- If both players delegate, the mediator will play A0.

### Analysis of Mediator and Payoff Intersection

#### No Delegation
If no players delegate, each player will likely choose independently. The potential equilibrium could be:
- (A0, A0): Both get 5 points
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 points

#### One Player Delegates
If only one player delegates:
- The mediator will choose A1 for the delegating player.
- The independent player would knowing this, might choose A0 to maximize their points.
  - Delegated player (A1), Independent player (A0): The delegated one gets 3 points, and the independent player gets 0 points.

#### Both Players Delegate
If both players delegate:
- Both mediators would choose A0.
  - Thus both players get 5 points, which is the optimal mutual solution.

### Strategic Voting
Since the mediators have identical behavior, approving either or both does not change the strategic outcome. Approving both is safe because it doesn't alter the strategy or potential outcomes, and ensures the mediator system works as expected irrespective of which one is chosen randomly in the case of tie votes.

### Final Decision 
Below is the JSON object indicating the approval of both mediators:

```json
{
    "M1": true,
    "M2": true
}
```

Here is the reasoning:
- Both mediators proposing identical strategies mean there's no detriment in approving both.
- Approving both increases the chances of having a mediator in case there's another layer of randomness in mediator selection based on voting.
- The optimal mutual outcome (5, 5) is achievable if both players delegate, thus approving both mediators makes the game clearly directed towards this optimal mutual outcome.

This leads to:
Returning the final JSON object containing your approvals:

{
    "M1": true,

To address this problem, let's carefully analyze both the game mechanics and the mediators proposed. We need to maximize our total points in the game, and we need to decide whether to approve the proposed mediators based on their behavior and potential strategy benefits.

**Game Setup:**
1. Both you and the other player choose a probability for each action (A0 or A1).
2. Actions result in points based on their combination:
   - (A0, A0): You get 5 points, Other gets 5 points.
   - (A0, A1): You get 0 points, Other gets 3 points.
   - (A1, A0): You get 3 points, Other gets 0 points.
   - (A1, A1): You get 3 points, Other gets 3 points.

**Mediator Proposal Analysis:**
1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
   - If 1 player delegates to the mediator, it will play action A1.
   - If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
   - If 1 player delegates to the mediator, it will play action A0.
   - If 2 players delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

**Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Approval Voting Outcome:**
   - The selected mediator will be uniformly chosen from those with the maximum number of approvals.
   
2. **Mediator Behaviors:**
   - **M1 (Player 1's Proposal):**
     - If both players delegate, both will play A0, resulting in the (A0, A0) outcome: Both get 5 points.
     - If only one player delegates, the mediator will play A1 for the delegator.
     
   - **M2 (Player 2's Proposal):**
     - This mediator always plays A0 regardless of the number of delegates.
     - This ensures a (A0, A0) outcome if both delegate: Both get 5 points.
     - If only one player delegates, the delegator plays A0.

**Maximizing Points:**

1. **If both players delegate to any mediator:**
   - Both mediators will play A0, resulting in (A0, A0): 5 points each.
   
2. **If only one player delegates:**
   - **With M1:** The delegator plays A1 (3 points if the other player plays A0, 3 points if the other player plays A1).
   - **With M2:** The delegator plays A0 (either 5 or 0 points depending on the other player's action).

Given this analysis, the mediators make the most sense when both players delegate because it guarantees the optimal outcome (5 points each), and individually delegating still provides predictable outcomes.

**Approval Strategy:**

- **Approve M1**: Provides flexibility and robust gains whether alone or paired with delegation.
- **Approve M2**: Ensures a guaranteed pair delegation outcome of A0, A0.

To maximize points and create opportunities for both individual and mutual strategies, we should approve both mediators.

**Final Decision:**

{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true

response:
To decide which mediators to approve, let's first analyze the game and the payoffs clearly. Following that, we can understand how each mediator functions and whether they help us maximize our points.

### Game Payoff Analysis:
We can summarize the payoffs in a matrix form:

|       | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| **P1: A0** | P1: 5 P2: 5 | P1: 0 P2: 3 |
| **P1: A1** | P1: 3 P2: 0 | P1: 3 P2: 3 |

1. **A0, A0**: Both get 5 points.
2. **A0, A1**: Player 1 gets 0 points; Player 2 gets 3 points.
3. **A1, A0**: Player 1 gets 3 points; Player 2 gets 0 points.
4. **A1, A1**: Both get 3 points.

Clearly, if both players coordinate and play A0, they both get the maximum points of 5 each. But coordinating without communication is difficult, which is why mediators exist in this game design.

### Mediator Analysis:
Let's review the mediators:

1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
   - If 1 player delegates, it will play action A1.
   - If 2 players delegate, it will play action A0.

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
   - If 1 player delegates, it will play action A0.
   - If 2 players delegate, it will play action A0.

### Evaluating Mediators:
#### Mediator from Player 1:
- **1 delegate:** The mediator will play A1. Here’s how it impacts:
  - If only one player (e.g., Player 1) delegates, and Player 2 does not delegate and plays independently.
  - If Player 2 plays A0, P1 gets 3 points (good for P1).
  - If Player 2 plays A1, both get 3 points (not optimal but not the worst).

- **2 delegates:** The mediator will play A0. 
  - If both delegate, they both get 5 points (maximizing for both).

Given this, if both players trust the mediator, they'll both delegate and get the best outcome, 5 points.

#### Mediator from Player 2:
- **1 delegate:** The mediator will play A0. Here's how it impacts:
  - If one player (e.g., Player 1) delegates, and Player 2 does not delegate and plays independently.
  - If Player 2 plays A0, both get 5 points (ideal).
  - If Player 2 plays A1, Player 1 gets 0 points (bad for P1).

- **2 delegates:** The mediator plays A0.
  - If both delegate, they both get 5 points (maximizing for both).

Given this, even if one delegates, it can be risky if the opponent decides to play independently and chooses A1. But getting both to delegate is beneficial.

### Decision:
Both mediators lead to the same outcome if both players delegate (both will play A0, both players get 5 points). However, approving both increases the chance of avoiding an unapproved mediator influencing the outcome negatively. 

Thus, my decision would be to approve both mediators to maximize coordination.

  "M1": true,
  "M2": true

Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:

response:
To decide which mediators to approve of, we need to evaluate their strategies and their impact on our overall game outcomes. 

### Game Analysis

#### Independent Actions:

If both players act independently, the expected payoffs can be broken down into mixed strategy payoffs depending on the probability of choosing actions A0 or A1.

Let's denote:
- \( p \) as the probability that Player 1 chooses A0.
- \( q \) as the probability that Player 2 chooses A0.

Payoffs for Player 1:
- When Player 1 chooses A0: \( 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q \)
- When Player 1 chooses A1: \( 3(1-q) + 3(q) = 3 \)

The expected payoff for Player 1 is:
\[ \text{Expected payoff} = 5pq + 0p(1-q) + 3(1-p)(1-q) + 3(1-p)q \]
\[ = 5pq + 3(1-p) \]

Payoffs for Player 2 are similar to calculate and lead to symmetric conditions for probabilities.

### Mediator Proposal Evaluation

Both mediators proposed by Player 1 and Player 2 have the same strategy:
- If only one player delegates, the mediator selects A1.
- If both players delegate, the mediator selects A0.

Let’s analyze both scenarios:

#### 1. One Player Delegates (Mediator selects A1):
- If Player 2 delegates (mediator plays A1) and Player 1 does not delegate:
  - Player 1 plays independently. If Player 1 also chooses A1 independently, both get 3 points.
  - If Player 1 chooses A0 independently, Player 1 gets 0 points, and Player 2 (mediator A1) gets 3 points.
  - In terms of Player 1's payoff, if they do not delegate, the expected payoff would be lower when Player 2 delegates and chooses A1.

#### 2. Both Players Delegate (Mediator selects A0):
- If both players delegate, they both choose A0 and get 5 points each.

The expected cooperative payoff when both delegate is higher (5 points each), as compared to non-delegated mixed strategies.

Given that both mediators act identically and follow the same strategy which is optimal if both players delegate, it makes sense to approve both mediators. This encourages Player 2 to delegate as well, leading to a better outcome for both.

### Final Decision

We will approve both mediators since they use an optimized strategy for maximizing individual and mutual benefits when both players delegate their actions.

Here is the resulting JSON object:

```json
{
    "M1": true,
    "M2": true
}
```

This approach ensures that the chosen mediator will implement the optimal collaborative strategy, ensuring we have the opportunity to maximize our points.

response:
Both proposed mediators are identical:

- If exactly 1 player delegates, the mediator plays **A1** for that delegating player (which guarantees that player gets at least 3, regardless of what the other does).
- If both players delegate, the mediator plays **A0** for both, yielding **(5,5)**, which is the best mutual outcome.

So having either mediator selected is beneficial, and since they are the same, there’s no downside to approving both. Approving both also maximizes the chance that *some* mediator is selected (depending on what the other player approves).

response:
Let's analyze the given situation to determine the optimal strategies.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Game without the Mediator:**
   - If both players choose A0, each gets 5 points.
   - If both players choose A1, each gets 3 points.
   - If you (Player 2) choose A0 and the other player (Player 1) chooses A1, you get 0 points and the other player gets 3 points.
   - If you (Player 2) choose A1 and the other player (Player 1) chooses A0, you get 3 points and the other player gets 0 points.

2. **Introducing the Mediator:**
   - If either player delegates to the mediator, the mediator will play A0.
   - If both players delegate to the mediator, both will effectively choose A0 and each will get 5 points.

3. **Analyzing Player 1's Potential Actions:**
   Assuming Player 1 is rational:
   - Player 1 knows that delegating to the mediator (A2) will always result in A0 being played.
   - If Player 1 chooses A2, they assume a high probability of you also choosing A2 resulting in 5 points each.
   
4. **Possible Strategies and Probabilities:**
   Considering the payoff matrix and the impact of delegation:

   - If both you and the other player completely trust the mediator, both should delegate (A2) leading to both scoring 5 points.
   - However, there is a risk if Player 1 doesn't delegate. Therefore, a mixed strategy might be necessary to capture any scenario where Player 1 deviates from the optimal delegate.

### Mixed Strategy:
To maximize total points, we need to distribute probabilities across all actions with a heavier inclination towards delegation given the mediator's role. A reasonable mixed strategy could be:
   - High probability for A2 (delegation).
   - Some probability on A0 to hedge against Player 1 not delegating.
   - Minimal probability on A1 as it generally returns lower points than other actions.

Considering this, a possible distribution might look like:

- **A0**: 25% (to capture scenarios where Player 1 does not delegate and selects A1)
- **A1**: 0% (because it typically leads to suboptimal payoffs)
- **A2**: 75% (maximizing the likelihood of receiving high consistent points)

### Final Answer:
```json
{"A0": 25, "A1": 0, "A2": 75}
```

This distribution aims to ensure you most frequently benefit from the mediator while still hedging against Player 1 deviating from delegation.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to form a mixed strategy for maximizing our expected total points.

### Step 1: Analyze the Payoff Structure
First, let's note the payoffs for each possible combination of actions taken by both players:

1. **Both choose A0**
    - You: 5 points
    - Other player: 5 points

2. **You choose A0, Other chooses A1**
    - You: 0 points
    - Other player: 3 points

3. **You choose A1, Other chooses A0**
    - You: 3 points
    - Other player: 0 points

4. **Both choose A1**
    - You: 3 points
    - Other player: 3 points

### Step 2: Analyze the Mediator's Strategy
The specifications for the mediator are as follows:
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator plays A0.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator also plays A0.

From the above rules, we can infer:
- If only you or the other player delegates (but not both), the mediator will select A0 for the delegator.
- If both delegate, both end up playing A0.

### Step 3: Strategy Analysis for Delegation
Considering the mediator's rules, if both you and the other player delegate, you both get 5 points since the mediator chooses A0. This is the highest payoff scenario (5 points each).

### Step 4: Compare against Independent Choices
Let's examine the payoffs for acting independently:
- If both independently choose A0, the payoff per player is 5 points each.
- Any mixed strategy where you or the other player chooses A1 leads to lower total combined payoffs (either 0-3, 3-0, or 3-3 payoffs in varying combinations).

### Step 5: Formulate the Optimal Mixed Strategy
Given the above analysis, it makes sense to delegate to the mediator because:
- For the highest expected payoff (5 points), both should delegate.

Hence, we should put a high probability on delegating to the mediator (action A2) to maximize our expected payoff.

### Final Strategy
Here’s the optimal probability distribution:
- Delegate to the mediator (A2) with near certainty (other players are likely thinking similarly due to the payoff structure).

Now, we have to convert this into integer percentages summing to 100.

Given the strong dominance of delegating, the strategy can be as follows:
- Delegating to the mediator: 100%.

### JSON Object
Returning the final JSON object:
```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}
```

In conclusion:
- The action "A2" (Delegate to Mediator) should have a 100% probability since it yields the highest expected payoff according to the game rules and the mediator’s predefined actions.

response:
To solve this problem, I need to carefully consider the potential outcomes and strategies available to both players. The key is to find a mixed strategy that maximizes my expected payoff given the potential actions of the other player and the mediator.

### Understanding the Basic Payoff Matrix
First, let's review the payoffs if no one delegates to the mediator:
- If both players pick A0: both get 5 points.
- If I pick A0 and the other picks A1: I get 0 points; they get 3 points.
- If I pick A1 and the other picks A0: I get 3 points; they get 0 points.
- If both pick A1: both get 3 points.

### Mediator Behavior
- If only I delegate to the mediator (A2 and the other player doesn't): the mediator will play A1 for me.
- If both players delegate to the mediator (A2 by both): the mediator will play A0 for both.

### Analyzing Possible Actions:
1. **Both players act independently (A0/A1)**: This follows the payoff matrix as described.
2. **Only one player delegates to the mediator (A2 single player scenario)**:
   - If I delegate and the other player plays A0 or A1, I will automatically play A1.
   - If the other player delegates and I act independently, they will play A1.

3. **Both players delegate to the mediator (A2 by both)**:
   - Both players end up playing A0, resulting in both getting 5 points each.

### Strategy Considerations:
1. **Delegating to Mediator Alone**:
   - If I delegate alone, my action is A1 no matter what the other player does. This gives 3 points if they choose A0 and 3 points if they choose A1.

2. **Not Delegating**:
   - I need to balance the probability of A0 and A1 such that it aligns best with potential other player's actions.

3. **Mutual Delegation**:
   - If both delegate, we both will play A0 due to mediator rules, resulting in both getting 5 points.

### Optimal Mixed Strategy:
1. **Maximizing Joint Payoff through Delegation**:
   - The highest symmetric payoff is when both delegates, resulting in both getting 5 points.
   - If at least one delegates, and if the other plays anything but A0, the expectation still needs to balance probabilities.

Given the above consideration:
- It seems if both players could know that the other would play A2, this would maximize the payoff.
- However, without coordination, delegating alone is less risky given payoffs for regular mixed strategies.

Therefore, a favorable mixed strategy might be:
- 0% for playing A0 as it's less advantageous given mediator potential outcomes.
- Higher delegation attempts for potentially coordinated results.

### Suggested Mixed Strategy in JSON:
```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 20, "A2": 80}
```
This balances a higher probability for delegation due to possible 5-points, while still considering small independent plays strategy to reflect slight uncertainty in the other player's decisions.

response:
Let's analyze the different aspects of this decision-making game and the proposed mediators. The objective is to maximize our total points received in the game. We are in the position of Player 2.

### Payoff Matrix
To remind ourselves of the payoffs:
- (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.

### Mediator Analysis
There are two mediators proposed, one by each player:

**Mediator proposed by Player 1:**
- If 1 player delegates to the mediator: it will play action A1.
- If 2 players delegate to the mediator: it will play action A0.

**Mediator proposed by Player 2:**
- If 1 player delegates to the mediator: it will play action A0.
- If 2 players delegate to the mediator: it will play action A0.

### Evaluating Mediator Designs

1. **Mediator proposed by Player 1 (M1):**
   - If only one player delegates, the mediator will play A1 for that delegate. The other player will decide independently.
     - If Player 1 delegates and plays A1 (and Player 2 acts independently playing A0, for example): Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
     - If Player 2 delegates and plays A1 (and Player 1 acts independently playing A0, for example): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
   - If both players delegate, the mediator plays A0 for both.
     - Both get 5 points (total 10 points in the game).

2. **Mediator proposed by Player 2 (M2):**
   - Whether one or both players delegate, the mediator will play A0.
     - If only Player 2 delegates to the mediator: Player 2 gets 5 points provided Player 1 also chooses A0.
     - If both players delegate, both get 5 points (total 10 points in the game).

### Strategic Decision
Approving both mediators might increase the chances of getting a mediator that leads to mutual cooperation (A0, A0). However, M2 is guaranteed to play A0 regardless, which secures at least 5 points if both delegate.

- **M1 has a condition where if only one player delegates, the mediator plays A1. This might lead to a non-cooperative state if one player decides to act opportunistically and does not delegate.**
- **M2 simplifies the game and reduces the risk of non-cooperation by always playing A0.**

### Conclusion
Given our goal to maximize total points, mediator M2 is the safer and better option to approve for consistent mutual benefit. We might not need to approve M1 because of its conditional behavior when only one player delegates.

  "M1": false,

To maximize the total points in this coordination game, we first analyze the payoff matrix:

- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

The game has two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). The (A0, A0) equilibrium is payoff-dominant, as it provides 5 points to each player compared to the 3 points in the (A1, A1) equilibrium. However, the game requires coordination to avoid the (0, 3) or (3, 0) outcomes.

Now, we evaluate the proposed mediators (M1 and M2). Both mediators are identical and follow these rules:
1. If only one player delegates, that player is assigned action A1.
2. If both players delegate, both are assigned action A0.

If a mediator is selected and both players delegate to it, they are guaranteed the (A0, A0) outcome, resulting in 5 points each. If only one player delegates, that player’s action is A1. Knowing this, the non-delegating player would choose A1 to maximize their own points (receiving 3 instead of 0), leading to the (A1, A1) outcome. This protects the delegating player from receiving 0 points. 

Since both mediators are identical and effectively provide a safe way for players to coordinate on the best possible outcome (5 points each), it is in the best interest of Player 2 to approve both.

To determine the optimal strategy, let's break down the problem step by step, focusing on the payoffs and the role of the mediator.

**Step 1: Understanding the Game Without Delegation**
- If both players choose A0: Both get 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: You get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: You get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
- If both players choose A1: Both get 3 points.

Without delegation, the payoff matrix for Player 1 (P1) is:
- P1(A0, A0) = 5
- P1(A0, A1) = 0
- P1(A1, A0) = 3
- P1(A1, A1) = 3

**Step 2: Considering the Mediator**
- If 1 player delegates, the mediator chooses A1 for that player.
- If 2 players delegate, the mediator chooses A0 for both players.

**Step 3: Payoffs with the Mediator**
Let's consider different scenarios involving the mediator:

Scenario 1: You delegate (A2) and the other player does not delegate:
- Mediator plays A1 for you, other player chooses A0 or A1.
  - If other player chooses A0, you get 3 points (because you chose A1).
  - If other player chooses A1, you get 3 points (because both chose A1).

Scenario 2: Both players delegate:
- Mediator plays A0 for both players.
  - Both get 5 points.

Scenario 3: You do not delegate, the other player delegates:
- P2 mediates and chooses A1 for P2.
  - If you choose A0, you get 0 points.
  - If you choose A1, you get 3 points.

**Step 4: Combining Probabilities**
Considering the mediator's impact and seeking to maximize points, each scenario's probabilities should account for the benefits of coordinating via the mediator:

- If you play A0 independently, you may get 0 (other chooses A1) or 5 points (other chooses A0).
- If you play A1 independently, you may get 3 points (regardless of the other choosing A0 or A1).
- If you delegate, you get either 3 or 5 points depending upon the other player's decision to delegate.

To encourage cooperation and achieve higher payoffs (via coordinating with the mediator to choose A0 when everyone delegates), a balanced mixture of actions, leaning towards delegation, would likely optimize the strategy.

Thus, a balanced approach considering both direct actions and the option to delegate might look like:
- Giving a good share to delegation (A2) with favorable points on coordination.
- Splitting the rest between A0 and A1 to hedge against independence.

Here's the final strategy in JSON:
```json
{"A0": 30, "A1": 20, "A2": 50}
```

**Explanation**:
- **A0** (30%): You might still gain 5 points if the other chooses A0.
- **A1** (20%): You are more guaranteed 3 points even if the other isn't delegating.
- **A2** (50%): A strong inclination to delegate ensures maximum points when both players comply, edging towards coordination for optimal collective outcome.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This is a coordination game with:
- Two pure Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving (5, 5) and (A1, A1) giving (3, 3)
- The (A0, A0) outcome is Pareto optimal but risky - if the other player defects to A1, I get 0
- A1 is safer - it guarantees at least 3 points

## Step 2: Compare the two mediators

**Mediator M1:**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**Mediator M2:**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1  
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

Both mediators are **identical**!

## Step 3: Analyze outcomes with the mediator

If the mediator is present:

1. **Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → (5, 5) ✓
2. **Only I delegate:** Mediator plays A1 for me; Player 2's best response to my A1 is A1 → (3, 3)
3. **Only Player 2 delegates:** Mediator plays A1 for them; my best response to their A1 is A1 → (3, 3)
4. **Neither delegates:** Back to the base game (likely mixed strategy giving ~3 each)

## Step 4: Determine delegation equilibrium

From my perspective:
- If Player 2 delegates: I get 5 by delegating vs 3 by not delegating → **Delegate**
- If Player 2 doesn't delegate: I get 3 either way → **Indifferent or weakly prefer delegating**

By symmetry, Player 2 has the same incentives. Therefore **(both delegate)** is the equilibrium, yielding the Pareto-optimal outcome of (5, 5).

## Step 5: Conclusion

Both mediators enable coordination on the best mutual outcome (5, 5), solving the coordination problem of the base game. Since they're identical and both beneficial, I approve both.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoff structure is:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This is a symmetric coordination game where:
- Mutual A0 gives the best payoff (5, 5)
- Mutual A1 gives a safe but lower payoff (3, 3)
- Miscoordination is worst (0 points for one player)

## Step 2: Analyze Both Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze Outcomes With the Mediator

Let me consider what happens with this mediator design:

**If both players delegate:**
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- Outcome: (5, 5) ✓ Best outcome!

**If only one player delegates:**
- Mediator plays A1 for that player
- The non-delegating player, seeing the delegate will play A1, should choose A1
- Outcome: (3, 3) - Safe outcome

**If neither delegates:**
- We play the original game
- Best case: coordinate on (A0, A0) for (5, 5)
- But there's risk of miscoordination or settling for (A1, A1)

## Step 4: Evaluate Strategic Impact

The delegation game creates these equilibria:
1. **(Both delegate)** → (5, 5) - A new, easily achievable good equilibrium!
2. **(Both play A0)** → (5, 5) - Original good equilibrium
3. **(Both play A1)** → (3, 3) - Original safe equilibrium

Crucially, if the other player delegates, I get:
- 5 points if I delegate too
- 3 points if I don't

This mediator **adds value** by:
- Creating a clear coordination mechanism (delegating) to reach the best outcome
- Not removing any existing equilibria
- Providing a focal point that helps both players achieve (5, 5)

## Conclusion

Both mediators are identical and beneficial. They help us coordinate on the best mutual outcome without creating any downside risk. I should approve both.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

response:
To determine the optimal course of action, it is critical to evaluate the payoffs and how the mediator's role might influence both players' strategies.

### Analyzing Payoffs Without Delegation

1. **Simultaneous Play (No Mediator)**
   - If both players select A0: Both get 5 points.
   - If Player 1 selects A0 and Player 2 selects A1: Player 1 gets 0 points, Player 2 gets 3 points.
   - If Player 1 selects A1 and Player 2 selects A0: Player 1 gets 3 points, Player 2 gets 0 points.
   - If both players select A1: Both get 3 points.

### Analyzing Payoffs With Delegation to the Mediator

2. **Delegation to Mediator**
   - If Player 1 delegates and Player 2 does not:
     - Mediator will play A1 for Player 1.
     - Payoffs depend on Player 2's choice.
   - If Player 2 delegates and Player 1 does not:
     - Mediator will play A1 for Player 2.
     - Payoffs depend on Player 1's choice.
   - If both players delegate to the mediator:
     - The mediator plays A0 for both players.
     - Both players get 5 points.

### Comparing Strategies

3. **Comparing Expected Payoffs:**
   - If both players always delegate (A2):
     - Guaranteed 5 points each.

Given that the best outcome for both players in terms of points happens when both players delegate to the mediator (both get 5 points), and the worst downside (0 points) is avoided, the optimal move heavily favors delegation to the mediator.

### Decision Making

Given this analysis, both players delegating to the mediator is the dominant strategy.

### Strategy Finalization
Assign the highest probability to the action that ensures the best possible outcome, which in this case is delegation (A2).

### Probability Distribution

Based on our analysis, the optimal strategy for maximizing total points is:
- 100% probability to delegate to the mediator.

### JSON Output

```json
{
  "A0": 0,
  "A1": 0,
  "A2": 100
}
```

This indicates that your chosen strategy is to always delegate to the mediator, ensuring the optimal outcome of 5 points for both players each round.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This game has two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → both get 5 points (best outcome)
- (A1, A1) → both get 3 points (worse outcome)

There's a **coordination problem**: we both want (A0, A0), but there's a risk of miscoordination.

## Step 2: Compare the mediators

**M1**: 1 player delegates → A1; 2 players delegate → A0
**M2**: 1 player delegates → A1; 2 players delegate → A0

Both mediators are **identical**!

## Step 3: Analyze the delegation game

With either mediator present, I can choose to:
- **Delegate (D)**: Let the mediator play for me
- **Not delegate**: Play independently

Key scenarios:
- **Both delegate**: Mediator plays A0 for both → (5, 5) ✓
- **Only I delegate**: Mediator plays A1 for me. Other player's best response is A1 → (3, 3)
- **Only other delegates**: Mediator plays A1 for them. My best response is A1 → (3, 3)  
- **Neither delegates**: Back to original game

## Step 4: Identify equilibria with mediator

(Both Delegate, Both Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium:
- If other delegates, I'm better off delegating too (get 5 vs max 3)
- Symmetric for the other player
- Outcome: (5, 5)

## Step 5: Evaluate the mediators

The mediator provides a **coordination device** that:
- Makes (D, D) a focal point
- Guarantees the good equilibrium (5, 5) when both delegate
- Doesn't hurt us - at worst we can choose not to delegate

Since both mediators are identical and both facilitate coordination to the better outcome, I should approve both.

My payoff matrix (as Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

The best outcome for me is mutual A0 coordination, giving us both 5 points.

## Step 2: Analyze Each Mediator

**Mediator M1 (my proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A1
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

**Mediator M2 (Player 2's proposal):**
- 1 player delegates → plays A0
- 2 players delegate → plays A0

## Step 3: Evaluate Outcomes with M1

If M1 is selected:
- **Both delegate**: M1 plays A0 for both → (5, 5) ✓
- **Only I delegate**: M1 plays A1 for me, Player 2 chooses independently. Their best response to A1 is A1 → (3, 3)
- **Only P2 delegates**: M1 plays A1 for them, my best response is A1 → (3, 3)

M1 requires **both players to delegate** to achieve the optimal (5, 5) outcome.

## Step 4: Evaluate Outcomes with M2

If M2 is selected:
- **Both delegate**: M2 plays A0 for both → (5, 5) ✓
- **Only I delegate**: M2 plays A0 for me, Player 2's best response to A0 is A0 → (5, 5) ✓
- **Only P2 delegates**: M2 plays A0 for them, my best response to A0 is A0 → (5, 5) ✓

M2 achieves the optimal (5, 5) outcome **as long as at least one player delegates**.

## Step 5: Strategic Decision

M2 is strictly better for me because:
- It's more robust - doesn't require coordinated delegation
- It guarantees I can secure 5 points just by delegating myself
- M1 has downside risk if only one player delegates

I should approve M2 but not M1, because:
- I want M2 to win
- If Player 2 approves both mediators and I also approve both, there could be a tie
- If Player 2 approves only M1 and I approve both, M1 wins (worse for me)
- Approving only M2 maximizes the chance M2 is selected

response:
To maximize total points, let's analyze the payoff matrix for Player 2 (me) based on the provided descriptions.

The actions are A0, A1, and A2 (Delegate to Mediator).
The basic payoffs (P1, P2) are:
- (A0, A0): (5, 5)
- (A0, A1): (0, 3)
- (A1, A0): (3, 0)
- (A1, A1): (3, 3)

The mediator rules are:
- If 1 player delegates (A2), the mediator plays action A1 for them.
- If 2 players delegate (A2), the mediator plays action A0 for both.

Based on this, we can construct the payoff matrix for Player 2:
1. **If P1 plays A0:**
   - P2 plays A0: (A0, A0) results in **5 points**.
   - P2 plays A1: (A0, A1) results in **3 points**.
   - P2 plays A2: 1 player delegates, mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A0, A1) = **3 points**.
2. **If P1 plays A1:**
   - P2 plays A0: (A1, A0) results in **0 points**.
   - P2 plays A1: (A1, A1) results in **3 points**.
   - P2 plays A2: 1 player delegates, mediator plays A1 for P2. Result (A1, A1) = **3 points**.
3. **If P1 plays A2:**
   - P2 plays A0: 1 player (P1) delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A0) = **0 points**.
   - P2 plays A1: 1 player (P1) delegates, mediator plays A1 for P1. Result (A1, A1) = **3 points**.
   - P2 plays A2: 2 players delegate, mediator plays A0 for both. Result (A0, A0) = **5 points**.

**Strategic Analysis:**
- **A2 vs. A1:** For Player 2, A2 weakly dominates A1. In every scenario where P1 plays A0 or A1, A2 and A1 yield the same points (3). However, if P1 plays A2, A2 yields 5 points while A1 yields only 3.
- **A2 vs. A0:** While A0 can yield 5 points if P1 plays A0, it is highly risky; if P1 plays A1 or A2, A0 yields 0 points. A2, conversely, yields a minimum of 3 points and reaches the maximum of 5 points if P1 also delegates.
- **Coordination:** Since Player 1 proposed this mediator, it acts as a strong signal that they intend to coordinate on the (A2, A2) outcome to reach the Pareto optimal payoff of 5 while maintaining a safety net of 3 points (compared to the high risk of playing A0 directly).

Given that A2 is both a safer strategy and a path to the maximum possible payoff through coordination, the most rational decision is to delegate fully.

To determine the optimal mixed strategy for Player 1, we'll think step-by-step about how our actions and the mediator's behavior affect the expected payoffs.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding Payoffs Without Mediator:**
    - If both players choose A0, each gets 5 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A0 and Player 2 chooses A1, Player 1 gets 0 points and Player 2 gets 3 points.
    - If Player 1 chooses A1 and Player 2 chooses A0, Player 1 gets 3 points and Player 2 gets 0 points.
    - If both players choose A1, each gets 3 points.

2. **Incorporating the Mediator:**
    - If Player 1 delegates to the mediator alone, the mediator will choose A1.
    - If both players delegate to the mediator, the mediator will choose A0.

3. **Payoffs with Mediator:**
    - If Player 1 alone delegates (A2) and Player 2 chooses A0: Player 1 gets 3 points and Player 2 gets 0 points.
    - If Player 1 alone delegates (A2) and Player 2 chooses A1: both get 3 points (since mediator plays A1).
    - If both delegate (A2), both get 5 points (since mediator plays A0).
    
4. **Finding Mixed Strategy:**
    - We need to balance between the payoffs in such a way that neither player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy.
    - For simplicity and to maximize points, it’s typically advantageous to increase the chances of either player getting 5 points.

Let's weight the strategies considering the benefits of the mediator:
- High delegation increases the probability of a guaranteed good payoff (either 3 or 5 points).

### Calculating Probabilities:

Using mixed strategies:
- Let \( p \) be the probability of choosing A0.
- Let \( q \) be the probability of choosing A1.
- Let \( r \) be the probability of choosing A2 (delegate to the mediator).

Optimal mixed strategy is usually found by balancing the expected payoffs to incentivize cooperation:
1. To form an equal mix where neither player would prefer deviating:
   - Player 1’s expected payoff when choosing A0 should be equal to the expected payoff when choosing A1 and choosing A2.

We will assign appropriate probabilities such that:
- Delegation happens often, but also independent choices are considered.
  
### Assigning Probabilities:

- Let's assume a greater emphasis on delegation (since it ensures at least decent payoffs and often rewards both players):
- Set higher probability for A2.

Considering delegation (A2) as majority action:
- **E.g., 50% delegation ensures high chances of securing mutual benefit**.
- Split remaining 50% somewhat equally between A0 and A1 to ensure mixed strategies remain incentivizing.

After reflecting on these observations:

### Final Calculated Mixed Strategy:

By balancing, a reasonable distribution could be:
- Assign 50% to delegation.
- Split remaining, slight preference to A0 due to its payoff symmetry if both choose it.

Thus, final probabilities:
- A0 = 25%
- A1 = 25%
- A2 = 50%

### JSON Final Answer:
```json
{"A0": 25, "A1": 25, "A2": 50}
```

This mixed strategy ensures adequate delegation while keeping independent actions viable.

response:
To maximize the total points in this game, let's analyze the payoff matrix for Player 2 (your position) by incorporating the "Delegate to Mediator" (A2) action.

### 1. Analysis of A0 and A1
Based on the payoff description:
- **(P1: A0, P2: A0)**: Both get 5.
- **(P1: A0, P2: A1)**: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A0)**: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0.
- **(P1: A1, P2: A1)**: Both get 3.

### 2. Analysis of the Mediator (A2)
The mediator's actions depend on how many players delegate:
- **If only P2 delegates (A2)**: The mediator plays A1 for P2.
  - If P1 plays A0: Outcome (A0, A1) → P1: 0, P2: 3.
  - If P1 plays A1: Outcome (A1, A1) → P1: 3, P2: 3.
- **If only P1 delegates (A2)**: The mediator plays A1 for P1.
  - If P2 plays A0: Outcome (A1, A0) → P1: 3, P2: 0.
  - If P2 plays A1: Outcome (A1, A1) → P1: 3, P2: 3.
- **If both delegate (A2, A2)**: The mediator plays A0 for both.
  - Outcome (A0, A0) → P1: 5, P2: 5.

### 3. The Combined Payoff Matrix for Player 2
| | P1: A0 | P1: A1 | P1: A2 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **P2: A0** | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| **P2: A1** | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| **P2: A2** | 3 | 3 | 5 |

### 4. Evaluating Strategies
Comparing your actions (A0, A1, A2):
- **A1** is weakly dominated by **A2**. A2 provides the same points (3) as A1 if Player 1 plays A0 or A1, but it provides more points (5 vs 3) if Player 1 plays A2.
- **A0** is high-risk. While it offers 5 points if Player 1 plays A0, it drops to 0 if Player 1 plays A1 or A2.
- **A2** is the most robust choice. It guarantees a minimum of 3 points regardless of whether Player 1 plays A0 or A1, and it achieves the maximum of 5 points if Player 1 also delegates.

Given that Player 1 proposed the mediator, it is a strong signal that they intend to use it. If Player 1 plays A2, your best response is A2 (5 points). Even if they were to play A0 or A1, A2 still secures you a safe 3 points, whereas A0 would risk 0 points. Thus, delegating is the most rational and beneficial strategy.

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

From my perspective as Player 2, the payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

This is a coordination game with two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) = (5, 5) - the best outcome
- (A1, A1) = (3, 3) - the safer but inferior outcome

The challenge is coordinating on the better equilibrium.

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates → play A1
- If 2 players delegate → play A0

## Step 3: Evaluate Delegation Outcomes

With either mediator:

**Both delegate:** Mediator plays A0 for both → (5, 5) ✓

**Only one delegates:** That player plays A1 via mediator, the other best responds with A1 → (3, 3)

**Neither delegates:** Original game with coordination uncertainty

## Step 4: Check if Delegation is Rational

If both delegate, we get (5, 5). Would either player want to deviate?
- If I deviate to not delegating while Player 1 delegates: Player 1 plays A1, my best response is A1 → I get 3 instead of 5
- So no incentive to deviate!

This means **(Delegate, Delegate) is a Nash equilibrium** yielding the optimal (5, 5) outcome.

## Step 5: Decision

Both mediators:
- Are functionally identical
- Enable coordination on the best possible outcome (5, 5)
- Create a stable equilibrium through mutual delegation
- Cannot hurt me if used strategically

Since both mediators are beneficial and identical, I should approve both.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
```
           P2: A0    P2: A1
P1: A0       5         0
P1: A1       3         3
```

This is a **coordination game** with two Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → (5, 5) - Pareto optimal
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3) - Risk-dominant

The problem: coordinating on the better equilibrium is uncertain.

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Analyze Outcomes with Mediator

**If both players delegate:**
- Mediator plays A0 for both players
- Payoff: (5, 5) ✓ **Guaranteed best outcome!**

**If only I delegate:**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Other player's best response: A1 (gets 3 vs 0)
- Payoff: (3, 3)

**If only other player delegates:**
- Mediator plays A1 for them
- My best response: A1 (gets 3 vs 0)
- Payoff: (3, 3)

**If neither delegates:**
- Back to original coordination problem
- Risk of coordination failure

## Step 4: Strategic Analysis

The mediator creates a clear focal point: **both delegate** → guaranteed (5, 5).

This is superior to the original game because:
- Without mediator: Coordination risk, might get (3, 3)
- With mediator + both delegate: Guaranteed (5, 5)

The delegation subgame makes (Delegate, Delegate) a strong equilibrium.

## Step 5: Voting Decision

Since:
- M1 and M2 are identical
- Both mediators facilitate coordination on the best outcome
- Having either mediator is beneficial
- There's no downside to approving both

I should approve both mediators.

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

My payoff matrix as Player 1:
- (A0, A0): 5 points
- (A0, A1): 0 points  
- (A1, A0): 3 points
- (A1, A1): 3 points

The Nash equilibrium of the base game gives approximately 3 points in expectation.

## Step 2: Analyze Each Mediator as a Delegation Game

I need to consider what happens based on who delegates:

### Mediator M1 (my proposal):
- **Both delegate**: M1 plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get **5**
- **Only I delegate**: M1 plays A1 for me, other player best responds with A1 → (A1, A1) → I get **3**
- **Only other delegates**: M1 plays A1 for them, I best respond with A1 → (A1, A1) → I get **3**  
- **Neither delegates**: Base game → approximately **3**

Delegation game payoffs:
|  | Other delegates | Other doesn't |
|--|----------------|---------------|
| I delegate | (5, 5) | (3, 3) |
| I don't | (3, 3) | (3, 3) |

**Problem**: Multiple equilibria exist - both players delegating (5,5) is good, but both not delegating (3,3) is also an equilibrium. This requires coordination.

### Mediator M2 (their proposal):
- **Both delegate**: M2 plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get **5**
- **Only I delegate**: M2 plays A0 for me, other player best responds with A1 → (A0, A1) → I get **0**
- **Only other delegates**: M2 plays A0 for them, I best respond with A0 → (A0, A0) → I get **5**
- **Neither delegates**: Base game → approximately **3**

Delegation game payoffs:
|  | Other delegates | Other doesn't |
|--|----------------|---------------|
| I delegate | (5, 5) | (0, 3) |
| I don't | (5, 5) | (3, 3) |

**Analysis**: The other player has a **dominant strategy to delegate** (gets 5 vs 3 regardless of my choice). Given they delegate, I get 5 whether I delegate or not. This is a unique, robust equilibrium guaranteeing me 5 points.

## Step 3: Compare

- **M1**: Requires successful coordination to reach the good outcome. Risk of coordination failure leading to only 3 points.
- **M2**: Other player has dominant incentive to delegate, which guarantees me 5 points. More robust and safer.

Since M2 provides the same payoff (5 points) with less coordination risk, I should approve M2 and reject M1.

To maximize our total points in this game setup, we need to consider the expected payoff for each possible action or combination thereof.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Standard Payoff Matrix Without Delegation:**

   From the provided payoffs:
   - If both choose A0: both get 5 points.
   - If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points.
   - If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points.
   - If both choose A1: both get 3 points.

2. **Considering Action Delegation:**

   If you decide to delegate (A2), the mediator will play A0 regardless of how many players delegate to it.

3. **Expected Payoffs When Considering Delegation:**

   Let's determine the expected payoff for each action combination involving delegation:

   - If you both delegate (A2): mediator will play A0 -> Both get 5 points.
   - If you delegate and the other player doesn't (either A0 or A1):
     - Other player chooses A0 -> You get 5 points.
     - Other player chooses A1 -> You get 0 points.

### Expected Payoff Calculations:

Let's denote the probabilities:
- \(P(A0) = p\)
- \(P(A1) = q\)
- \(P(A2) = 100 - p - q\)

If we assume the other player will also play some mixed strategy \( p_0 \) for A0, \( p_1 \) for A1 and \( p_2 \) for A2 similar to ours, then our expected payoff for each action can be calculated using the probabilities of the other's actions.

Here's the overall strategy:

1. **Delegating to Mediator:**
   If we delegate (A2), we bet that our partner may also delegate or we will face their non-delegated play.
   - If both delegate, we both get 5 points.
   - If only we delegate:
     - We face their A0 -> 5 points.
     - We face their A1 -> 0 points.
   
   Since delegation to A0 has a higher chance of getting 5 points (even safer if we think the other player would delegate too), we tend to have a higher expected payoff.

2. **Mixed Strategy Balance:**
   Given the symmetrical payoffs but higher utility from delegation, we can balance some non-delegated actions with some delegated ones to avoid being predictable in competitive non-cooperative games.

To optimize, we can aim for:
- Delegate with a substantial probability.
- Still add a minor probability on A1 to balance competitive non-cooperative plays.

### Final Mixed Strategy:

We favor delegation, rationalizing the expected higher utility and its cooperative equilibrium essence. We blend it with minor A1 probability to hedge against total non-cooperation from the other.

Hence, the formulated distribution could be:
- \(P(A0) = 20\)%
- \(P(A1) = 10\)%
- \(P(A2) = 70\)%

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the payoff matrix
From my perspective (Player 2):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator mechanism
- If only 1 player delegates: mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate: mediator plays A0 for both players

## Step 3: Calculate expected payoffs for each action

**If I choose A2 (Delegate):**
- If opponent also delegates: Mediator plays A0 for both → I get 5
- If opponent doesn't delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me → I get 3 (regardless of opponent's choice between A0/A1)
- Expected: 5p + 3(1-p) = 3 + 2p, where p = probability opponent delegates

**If I choose A1:**
- Always get 3 (regardless of opponent's action)

**If I choose A0:**
- Against opponent's A0: get 5
- Against opponent's A1 (or opponent delegates): get 0
- Very risky unless certain opponent plays A0

## Step 4: Identify Nash equilibria

**(Delegate, Delegate) Analysis:**
- If opponent delegates with certainty, my payoffs are:
  - Delegate: 5
  - A1: 3
  - A0: 0
- Best response: Delegate

By symmetry, if I delegate, opponent's best response is also to delegate. This is a Nash equilibrium yielding (5,5).

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

The mediator mechanism was specifically designed to solve the coordination problem. The (Delegate, Delegate) outcome:
- Is a Nash equilibrium
- Gives both players 5 (the maximum possible payoff)
- Pareto-dominates all other equilibria
- Is the focal point of this game

Since delegation gives me at least 3 (same as A1) and potentially 5 (if opponent also delegates), and there's no reason for a rational opponent to avoid delegating, the optimal strategy is to delegate with certainty.

Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding the payoff structure

From my perspective (Player 1), the original game payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Analyzing the mediator mechanism

The mediator plays:
- **A1** if only 1 player delegates
- **A0** if both players delegate

## Step 3: Building the complete payoff matrix

With delegation as option A2, my payoffs are:

| My Action | vs A0 | vs A1 | vs A2 |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| A0        | 5     | 0     | 0     |
| A1        | 3     | 3     | 3     |
| A2        | 3     | 3     | 5     |

**Reasoning:**
- If I delegate (A2) and opponent plays A0 or A1: only I delegate, so mediator plays A1 for me → I get 3
- If I delegate (A2) and opponent delegates (A2): both delegate, so mediator plays A0 for both → I get 5

## Step 4: Strategic analysis

**Key observation**: A2 weakly dominates A1
- Against A0 or A1: both give me 3 points
- Against A2: A2 gives me 5, while A1 gives me 3

Therefore, A1 should never be played.

## Step 5: Finding Nash equilibria

Between A0 and A2:
- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5. Deviating to A2 gives 3. This is a Nash equilibrium.
- **(A2, A2)**: Both get 5. Deviating to A0 gives 0, to A1 gives 3. This is a Nash equilibrium.
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3. This is Pareto-dominated.

## Step 6: Selecting the optimal strategy

(A2, A2) is superior to (A0, A0) because:
1. **Higher security**: A2 guarantees at least 3 points regardless of opponent's action, while A0 risks getting 0
2. **Focal point**: As the player who proposed the mediator, delegation serves as the natural coordination device
3. **Stronger stability**: Deviating from (A2, A2) to A0 loses 5 points, making it less tempting than deviating from (A0, A0)

The mediator was designed precisely to facilitate coordination on the mutually beneficial outcome through delegation.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P1
response:
Let me break down this game step by step.

## Step 1: Understand the Basic Payoff Matrix

As Player 1, my payoffs are:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## Step 2: Analyze the Game Without Delegation

If the other player plays A0 with probability p:
- My expected payoff from A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- My expected payoff from A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 (constant!)

So A1 gives me 3 points regardless of opponent's action. A0 gives me 5p points.
- I prefer A0 when 5p > 3, i.e., when p > 0.6
- I prefer A1 when p < 0.6

## Step 3: Analyze Delegation (A2)

When I delegate, the mediator plays A0 for me (whether 1 or 2 players delegate).

Let me check the payoffs when I choose A2:
- If other plays A0: mediator plays A0 for me → (A0, A0) → I get 5
- If other plays A1: mediator plays A0 for me → (A0, A1) → I get 0
- If other delegates: mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get 5

**Key insight: A2 (delegation) gives me the exact same payoffs as playing A0 directly!**

## Step 4: Consider Strategic Implications

Since A0 and A2 are equivalent in payoff terms, the game reduces to:
- Playing (A0 or A2): Expected payoff = 5 × P(other plays A0 or delegates)
- Playing A1: Expected payoff = 3 (always)

## Step 5: Interpret the Signal from Player 2

Player 2 proposed this mediator that plays A0. This is a strong signal that:
1. They recognize the (A0, A0) outcome yields 5 points each (best mutual outcome)
2. They likely intend to delegate (or play A0) to achieve this coordination
3. The mediator serves as a commitment device for mutual cooperation

## Step 6: Determine Optimal Response

If Player 2 delegates (highly likely given they proposed the mediator):
- If I play A0 or A2: I get 5
- If I play A1: I get 3

Delegating is optimal because:
- It matches Player 2's likely strategy (mutual delegation → guaranteed 5 points)
- It signals cooperation and reciprocity
- It's a best response if Player 2 delegates with any probability > 0.6

# Step-by-Step Analysis

## 1. Understanding the Payoff Matrix
From my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

## 2. Understanding the Mediator
- If only 1 player delegates → that player plays A1
- If both players delegate → both play A0

## 3. Finding Nash Equilibria

Let me check all pure strategy combinations:

**Without mediator:**
- (A0, A0) → (5, 5): Neither wants to deviate ✓ Nash Equilibrium
- (A1, A1) → (3, 3): Neither wants to deviate ✓ Nash Equilibrium  
- (A0, A1) or (A1, A0): Not equilibria (one player wants to deviate)

**With mediator:**
- (A2, A2): Both delegate → both play A0 → (5, 5)
  - If I deviate to A0: other delegates alone → plays A1 → I get 0 < 5 (no incentive)
  - If I deviate to A1: other delegates alone → plays A1 → I get 3 < 5 (no incentive)
  - By symmetry, other player also has no incentive to deviate
  - ✓ This is a Nash Equilibrium!

## 4. Comparing Equilibria

Best equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) both give 5 points
Worst equilibrium: (A1, A1) gives 3 points

## 5. Coordination Analysis

The key insight: **I proposed this mediator**, which serves as a strong focal point.

- The other player knows I designed this coordination mechanism
- This signals my intention to use it
- Rational response: they should also delegate
- (A2, A2) is a stable, high-payoff equilibrium

## 6. Risk Assessment

If I play A2:
- Other plays A2 → I get 5 (best outcome)
- Other plays A0 → I get 3 (okay)
- Other plays A1 → I get 3 (okay)

This is actually quite safe! The worst case from delegating is 3 points.

## 7. Strategic Reasoning

Using iterated best response:
- If other player expects me to use my proposed mediator, they should delegate
- If I expect them to delegate, I should delegate
- This reasoning converges to both delegating

Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Base Game

The payoff matrix from my perspective (Player 1):
- (A0, A0): I get 5, other gets 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0, other gets 3  
- (A1, A0): I get 3, other gets 0
- (A1, A1): I get 3, other gets 3

This is a coordination game with:
- **A0** = risky but potentially high reward (0 or 5)
- **A1** = safe, guaranteed 3 points

Two Nash equilibria exist:
1. Both play A0: (5, 5) - **efficient but risky**
2. Both play A1: (3, 3) - **safe but suboptimal**

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediators

Both M1 and M2 are **identical**:
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1 (safe strategy)
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0 (coordinated efficient outcome)

## Step 3: Evaluate Outcomes with Mediator

If both delegate: Both play A0 → **(5, 5)** ✓

If only I delegate: 
- I play A1 (safe strategy)
- Regardless of what other does: **I get 3** (guaranteed floor)

If neither delegates: Back to original coordination problem

## Step 4: Strategic Assessment

The mediator design is clever because:

1. **Provides coordination mechanism**: Both delegating achieves the efficient (5, 5) outcome
2. **Offers downside protection**: Delegating alone still guarantees 3 points (vs. risk of 0 if playing A0 alone)
3. **Creates focal point**: Makes (Delegate, Delegate) → (5, 5) a salient equilibrium
4. **No downside**: Doesn't eliminate any beneficial strategies

Since M1 and M2 are identical, there's no strategic difference between them. Both facilitate cooperation and provide the same beneficial coordination mechanism.

## Conclusion

Both mediators help solve the coordination problem and enable the efficient outcome without introducing any strategic disadvantage.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

**Step 1: Understand the Mediator Options**
The two mediators proposed have identical strategies:
- If either 1 or 2 players delegate to them, they will select action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 1:
- Single player delegates: plays A0
- Both players delegate: plays A0

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
- Single player delegates: plays A0
- Both players delegate: plays A0

**Step 2: Analyze the Payoff Matrix**
The game payoffs are as follows:
- (A0, A0): Player 2 gets 5 points, Player 1 gets 5 points.
- (A0, A1): Player 2 gets 0 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.
- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 0 points.
- (A1, A1): Player 2 gets 3 points, Player 1 gets 3 points.

**Step 3: Evaluate the Mediator's Impact on Outcome**
Both mediators, if chosen, will always play A0:
- If both players delegate to the mediator, the outcome will be (A0, A0), giving each player 5 points.
- If only one player delegates, that player will play A0 due to the mediator's decision, while the other player's independent action could result in:
  - (A0, A1): 0 points for delegating player, 3 points for independent player
  - (A0, A0): 5 points for both if independent player also plays A0
  - (A0, A1): If the independent player defaults to A1, the delegating player would receive 0 points while the independent player receives 3.

**Step 4: Compare Delegating vs Acting Independently**
- **Both delegate**: best for both (5, 5)
- **One delegates, other chooses independently**: risks lower payoff given the potential choices of the independent player.

**Step 5: Decision on Approval**
Given that both mediators behave identically, approving both would be logical to maximize potential cooperation by increasing the chance both will delegate. This ensures an optimal shared outcome of (A0, A0) which maximizes points.

**Conclusion**
Approving both mediators aligns with the goal of maintaining a fair outcome of 5 points each through mutual delegation, given their identical behavior.

### Final JSON Output
```json
{
  "M1": true,
  "M2": true
}
```

This ensures that both mediator options are approved, enhancing the likelihood of mutual delegation and maximizing the points for both players in the game.

Mediator M2 is better for me than M1 in every delegation scenario:

- If **both delegate**, **both mediators play A0**, giving me **5**.
- If **only I delegate**:
  - Under **M1**, the mediator plays **A0**, which risks giving me **0** if Player 1 plays A1.
  - Under **M2**, the mediator plays **A1**, which guarantees me **3** no matter what Player 1 does.

Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Understand my payoff matrix (as Player 2)

|          | Opp plays A0 | Opp plays A1 |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| I play A0| 5            | 0            |
| I play A1| 3            | 3            |

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator's behavior

- If only I delegate: Mediator plays A1 for me
- If only opponent delegates: Mediator plays A1 for them  
- If both delegate: Mediator plays A0 for both

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs for each delegation scenario

**Case 1: I delegate, opponent doesn't**
- Mediator plays A1 for me
- Regardless of opponent's action (A0 or A1), I get 3 points

**Case 2: Opponent delegates, I don't**
- Mediator plays A1 for opponent
- If I play A0: I get 0
- If I play A1: I get 3
- Best response: A1 (payoff = 3)

**Case 3: Both delegate**
- Mediator plays A0 for both
- We both get 5 points (best possible outcome!)

**Case 4: Neither delegates**
- Standard game Nash equilibrium: both mix (60% A0, 40% A1)
- Expected payoff: 3 points

## Step 4: Strategic analysis

Comparing the outcomes:
- Both delegate: 5 points (optimal!)
- One delegates: 3 points for delegator
- Neither delegates: 3 points (Nash equilibrium)

**Is mutual delegation a Nash equilibrium?**
- If opponent delegates, my best response is to delegate (5 > 3)
- By symmetry, if I delegate, opponent's best response is to delegate
- Yes! Mutual delegation is a Nash equilibrium with payoff (5,5)

## Step 5: Decision

Since:
1. Mutual delegation gives the best outcome (5 points each)
2. Mutual delegation is a Nash equilibrium
3. Even if opponent doesn't delegate, I still get 3 points (same as Nash)
4. I proposed this mediator (suggesting it's designed for mutual benefit)

The rational choice is to **delegate with 100% probability**.

Let me work through this step by step.

## Step 1: Understanding the Payoffs

From my perspective (Player 1), the payoff matrix is:
```
                Other Player
                A0      A1
Player 1  A0    5       0
          A1    3       3
```

## Step 2: Analyzing the Mediator Option

When the mediator is involved:
- If I delegate (A2): The mediator plays A0 for me (whether 1 or 2 players delegate)
- If the other player delegates: The mediator plays A0 for them

So my payoffs when delegating (A2):
- vs Other's A0: 5
- vs Other's A1: 0  
- vs Other's A2: 5

**Key insight: Delegating (A2) gives me identical payoffs to playing A0 directly!**

## Step 3: Identifying Nash Equilibria

This game has:
1. **Pure equilibrium**: (A0, A0) → both get 5 points
2. **Pure equilibrium**: (A1, A1) → both get 3 points  
3. **Mixed equilibrium**: Both players need to be indifferent between strategies

## Step 4: Finding the Mixed Strategy Equilibrium

For mixed strategies, let me find when I'm indifferent:

Let q₂ = probability other player plays A1

- My payoff from A0 or A2: 5(1 - q₂)
- My payoff from A1: 3

Setting these equal:
- 5(1 - q₂) = 3
- 1 - q₂ = 0.6
- q₂ = 0.4

So at equilibrium, the other player plays A1 with probability 0.4 and (A0 or A2) with probability 0.6.

By symmetry, I should also play A1 with probability 0.4 and (A0 or A2) with probability 0.6.

## Step 5: Choosing Between A0 and A2

Since A0 and A2 are strategically equivalent, I can choose either. Given that Player 2 proposed this mediator (suggesting they may use it), I'll delegate my entire 60% probability to the mediator for coordination purposes.

## Final Answer

The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium allocation:

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 40, "A2": 60}
```

Let's analyze the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)

We are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):

|         | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)** | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **A1 (P2)** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

So, in the base game, each player wants to coordinate on (A0, A0) for mutual benefit (5 each), but if only one person plays A0 and the other A1, the one playing A1 gets 3 while the one playing A0 gets 0.

However, playing A1 against A0 gives you 3, and playing A1 against A1 gives you 3 — so A1 is never worse than A0 against A1, and A1 is better than A0 against A0? Wait — no.

Wait: You are Player 2.

Let’s reorganize the payoffs from **Player 2's perspective** (you):

- If you play A0:
  - P1 plays A0 → you get 5
  - P1 plays A1 → you get 0

- If you play A1:
  - P1 plays A0 → you get 3
  - P1 plays A1 → you get 3

So from your perspective:
- A0 gives you 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1
- A1 gives you 3 regardless of what P1 does

So playing A1 is **never worse** than A0 — in fact, it guarantees 3, while A0 can give you 0.

So A1 is **weakly dominant** for you.

In fact, the Nash equilibria of the base game:
- (A1, A1): both get 3 → no incentive to deviate
- (A0, A0): both get 5 → but if you think P1 will play A0, you get 5 vs 3 if you switch to A1 → so (A0,A0) is unstable

Actually, let’s compute best responses.

For you (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0 → you best respond with A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1 → you best respond with A1 (3 = 3, so indifferent, but A1 is safe)

So your best response:
- To A0: A0
- To A1: A1 (indifferent, but A1 doesn't risk 0)

But if you assume P1 is rational, then P1 will not want to play A0 if you play A1 (since P1 gets 0), so P1 wants to play A1 if you play A1.

Wait — P1’s payoffs (same matrix):

- P1 plays A0:
  - You (P2) play A0 → P1 gets 5
  - You play A1 → P1 gets 0 → bad
- P1 plays A1:
  - You play A0 → P1 gets 3
  - You play A1 → P1 gets 3 → always 3

So for P1, playing A1 is also weakly dominant:
- If you play A0 → P1 gets 0 if plays A0, 3 if plays A1 → so better to play A1
- If you play A1 → P1 gets 3 either way

So both players have A1 as weakly dominant strategy.

Therefore, the only **Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), where both get 3.

So in the base game, **rational players will end up at (A1, A1)** → you get 3.

But there is a **Pareto-dominant outcome**: (A0, A0), where you both get 5. But neither player has incentive to unilaterally play A0, since they risk getting 0.

So the outcome is inefficient: both get 3 when they could get 5.

---

### Step 2: Mediator system

Now each player can **delegate** their move to a mediator.

You get to **approve** mediators, and the mediator with **most approvals** wins (chosen uniformly at random if tie).

The proposed mediators:
- M1: Proposed by Player 1
- M2: Proposed by Player 2

**Both mediators have identical behavior**:
> If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1  
> If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

So both mediators behave the **same way**.

We are to decide: Which mediators do we approve?

You are Player 2.

We need to decide whether to approve M1 or M2, or both, or neither.

But since both mediators have **identical behavior**, they are **strategically equivalent**.

So, if we approve both, then both M1 and M2 will have the same number of approvals (assuming the other player approves one or both).

But **the final mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve both, and the other player approves one, then you both have 1 approval → so both are tied for max → pick one at random → you have 50% chance of getting M1, 50% M2 — but since both are identical, it doesn't matter.

If you approve one (say M1), and the other player approves the same, they also have 1 ap, so tie → random choice.

If you approve both, and the other approves both, then both have 2 approvals → still random → but since both are identical, outcome is same.

If you approve both, but the other approves only one (say M1), then M1 has 2 approvals (you + P1), M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

But since both mediators play the same, **the outcome doesn’t depend on which mediator wins**.

So the only thing that matters is **who ends up being the mediator**, and since both behave identically, it doesn't matter.

Therefore, the **behavior of the system depends only on the total number of delegations**, not on which mediator is picked.

Let’s define:

Let D be the number of players who delegate to the mediator: 0, 1, or 2.

- If 0 delegate → both play independently → go back to base game → equilibrium at (A1, A1) → you get 3
- If 1 delegates → the mediator plays A1 → so the delegating player's action is A1, the non-delegating player chooses their own action
- If 2 delegate → the mediator plays A0 → so both players play A0 → you get 5

So the outcome depends on delegation.

Now, the **mediator only acts when someone delegates**, and its behavior depends on how many delegates.

But the key: both mediators behave the same.

So you should always **approve mediators that have the same behavior**, unless there's a strategic reason not to.

In fact, if it doesn’t matter which mediator is used (they are identical), and you want to **maximize your chance of getting a good outcome**, then you want to:
- Ensure the mediator **can be chosen** if desired
- Especially since you can’t control the other player’s choice

Now, **important**: you are choosing which mediators to approve, and the **winning mediator is the one with the most approvals** (random if tie).

So if you **don’t approve any**, then the mediator is not available → no delegation possible → you are forced to act independently → outcome is (A1, A1) → 3 points.

But if you **approve at least one**, and the other player also approves at least one, then it's possible for delegation to occur.

Let’s consider possible outcomes.

But here's the key insight:

> You want to **increase the chance that both players delegate** → because if both delegate, **mediator plays A0** → both get 5 → better for you.

> But if only one delegates, mediator plays A1 → so one player plays A1 → the other plays independently.

Now, **what will the non-delegating player do?**

They are playing independently, and for them, A1 is weakly dominant, so they will play A1.

So:
- If only **one player delegates**: the delegate plays A1 (per mediator rules), the non-delegate plays A1 (rationally) → both play A1 → you get 3.

- If **both delegate**: both play A0 → you get 5.

- If **neither delegates**: both play independently → both play A1 (since A1 weakly dominant) → you get 3.

So the **only way to get 5 points** is if **both players delegate**.

Thus, your point outcome:
- 5 if both delegate
- 3 if 0 or 1 delegate

So to maximize your expected payoff, you want to **maximize the probability that both delegate**.

But delegation only happens if the mediator is available — i.e., if **at least one player approves** the winning mediator.

So if you don’t approve any mediator, then no mediator is available → no delegation → both act independently → both play A1 → you get 3.

So never choosing delegation leads to 3.

But if you approve a mediator, you open the possibility of delegation.

Now, the other player is also deciding whom to approve.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own points.

We are Player 2.

Let’s think about incentives.

Suppose **you approve both mediators**.

Then:
- The other player also wants to get 5 points → so they want *both* to delegate → so they will try to ensure that the mediator is available and that they can coordinate on delegation.

But there’s a catch: if only one of the mediators is approved, then even if both approve it, then it can win.

But if both mediators are approved by both players, then both have 2 approvals → tie → pick uniformly at random → mediator selected → then both delegate → A0 → you get 5.

But suppose you approve only one mediator (say M1), and the other player approves only M1 → then M1 wins → both delegate → A0 → you get 5.

Same if you approve only M1 and they approve M2 → then M1 and M2 each have 1 approval → tie → random selection → say M1 wins → both delegate → A0.

So in all cases, **if both players approve at least one mediator (possibly different ones), then it’s possible for a mediator to be selected** — and **if both people delegate**, then both get A0 → 5.

But here’s the catch: do both players actually want to delegate?

Let’s think about **individual incentives to delegate**.

Suppose you approve a mediator (say M1), and assume the mediator will be chosen (either because only one is approved, or tied).

Now, **will you delegate**?

Let’s analyze:

You are deciding whether to delegate or not.

If you delegate:
- You get whatever the mediator plays, depending on how many delegate.

But you alone decide to delegate — the other player may not.

So you need to consider the other player’s choice.

But we can think about **dominance**.

Let’s suppose you **do not delegate**.

Then:
- The mediator chooses what you do.
- But no, if you don’t delegate, you choose your own action.

So possibilities:

Case 1: You **don’t delegate**, and the other player **does delegate** → follows the mediator.

Then, since only one player delegates → mediator plays A1 → the delegator plays A1 → you (Player 2) play independently.

You will play A1 (dominant strategy), so resulting actions: A1 (you), A1 (other) → you get 3.

Case 2: You **don’t delegate**, and the other player **doesn’t delegate** → both play independently → A1 vs A1 → you get 3.

Case 3: You **do delegate**, and the other player **doesn’t delegate** → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A1 → you get 3.

Case 4: You **do delegate**, and the other player **does delegate** → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → other plays A0 → you get 5.

So your payoff depends on whether **both** delegate.

But **you can only control your own delegation**, not the other player’s.

So if you don’t delegate, you get 3 regardless.

If you **do delegate**, you get 3 unless the other player also delegates → in which case you get 5.

So **you get a higher payoff if both delegate** → but you can't control the other player.

So you might be afraid of delegating: if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get A1 (3) — same as not delegating.

If you delegate and the other does, you get 5 → better.

But if you don’t delegate, you never get more than 3.

So **you have a strategic incentive to delegate — but only if you expect the other to delegate as well**.

But there’s a coordination issue.

However, here’s a key: you are **choosing which mediator to approve** — and you can **influence the probability** that the mediator is available.

But you don’t control the other player.

But the **mediator is chosen from those approved** — so to **maximize the chance of delegation**, you want the mediator to be **available**, because if no mediator is available, delegation can’t happen.

So if you **do not approve any mediator**, then no mediation is possible → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 3.

If you **approve at least one mediator**, then as long as the other player also approves at least one, **there will be a mediator chosen**, so delegation is possible.

But can you **force** both players to delegate?

No — but you can **increase the chance** that delegation occurs.

However, **each player must decide whether to delegate**, and they only benefit if both delegate.

So unless there’s a way to **coordinate** on delegation, it may not happen.

But here’s the insight: **if both players approve at least one mediator, then a mediator is available → so delegation is possible.**

Then, if **both players expect the other to delegate**, they might both delegate and get 5.

But is delegation a best response?

Yes — if you think the other player will delegate, then:
- If you delegate → you get 5
- If you don’t → you get 3 (since other player plays A1 via delegation or independently?)

Wait — if the other player delegates, they play A1 if only one delegates.

But if both delegate, the mediator plays A0.

So suppose you believe the other player will delegate.

Then:
- If you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate → only one delegates (the other player) → mediator plays A1 → other player plays A1 → you play independently → you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3

So **you strictly prefer to delegate** if you expect the other to delegate.

Similarly, the other player has the same incentive.

So if **both believe the other will delegate**, then both want to delegate → (delegation, delegation) is a Nash equilibrium in the delegation stage.

But there’s also a **pure strategy equilibrium** where **neither delegates**:
- If you don’t delegate, and the other doesn’t → you get 3
- If you deviate and delegate, you risk getting 3 (if other doesn't delegate) instead of 3 → no benefit

But if others don’t delegate, then:
- If you unilaterally delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A1 → you get 3
- Same as not delegating → so indifferent

But if the other player doesn’t delegate, and you delegate → you get 3 (same as if you didn’t).

So you are indifferent.

But if you **can** coordinate on both delegating, you both get 5 → better than 3.

So the **only way to get more than 3** is to **both delegate**.

But delegation is only possible if **a mediator is available**.

So for delegation to be possible, at least one mediator must be approved by **some player**.

The **only way delegation can happen** is if **at least one mediator is approved by at least one player**.

But even then, delegation **depends on both players actually choosing to delegate**.

So now, the best strategy for you is:

- Approve **at least one mediator**, so that delegation is possible → then if the other player also approves, and both players can coordinate on delegation, you both get 5.

- If you **don’t approve any**, then no mediator → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 3.

Since 5 > 3, you **prefer** the possibility of 5.

So you **must** approve **at least one**.

Now, which ones?

M1 and M2 behave identically.

So approving both is **no worse than approving one**.

But why approve only one?

Suppose you approve only M1.

Then, if the other player approves only M2 → then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 → tie → random → either can win → then if a mediator is chosen, delegation can happen → so **delegation is still possible**.

Same if both approve M1 → M1 wins → delegation possible.

If you approve both, and the other approves only one → you still have possible delegation.

Even if you approve both, and the other approves both → then both have 2 approvals → tie → one chosen at random → still delegation possible.

So **no downside to approving both** — you **don’t reduce the chance of delegation**.

In fact, **approving both guarantees that no matter what the other player does**, the mediator will be available.

- If you approve both, even if the other player approves **no one**, then both mediators are unapproved → **no mediator** → no delegation → you get 3.

But if the other player approves **at least one**, and you approve both, then the number of approvals for each is at least 1 → so at least one mediator has the maximum number of approvals → so one is chosen → delegation possible.

So the only way delegation fails is if:
- You approve none, **or**
- You approve some, but the other approves none

So **to maximize your chance of delegation**, you want to minimize the risk of no mediator being available.

Approving both mediators **increases the chance** that, even if the other player approves only one, that one is approved by you → the chosen mediator is the one with max approvals.

3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Looking at this problem step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (my perspective)

|        | Other: A0 | Other: A1 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| My A0  | 5         | 0         |
| My A1  | 3         | 3         |

## Step 2: Analyze the base game without mediator

To find the Nash equilibrium:
- If opponent plays A0 with probability q: My payoff from A0 = 5q, from A1 = 3
- I'm indifferent when 5q = 3, so q = 3/5
- By symmetry, the Nash equilibrium is both playing (3/5 on A0, 2/5 on A1)
- Expected payoff: 3 points

## Step 3: Understand the mediator mechanism

- If only 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1 for that player
- If both players delegate → mediator plays A0 for both players

## Step 4: Calculate outcomes with delegation

When I delegate:
- vs opponent's A0: Mediator plays A1 for me → (A1, A0) → I get 3
- vs opponent's A1: Mediator plays A1 for me → (A1, A1) → I get 3  
- vs opponent delegates: Mediator plays A0 for both → (A0, A0) → I get 5

## Step 5: Check for equilibria with delegation

**Mutual Delegation Equilibrium:**
If both delegate (probability 1):
- Outcome: (A0, A0) → both get 5 points

Is this stable? If opponent delegates:
- My payoff from A0: 0 (since opponent actually plays A1 via mediator)
- My payoff from A1: 3
- My payoff from delegating: 5 ✓

Delegation is the strict best response to delegation. By symmetry, this is a Nash equilibrium.

## Step 6: Compare equilibria

1. **Mutual delegation (0, 0, 1)**: Payoff = 5 ✓
2. **Original mixed Nash (3/5, 2/5, 0)**: Payoff = 3
3. **Mixed with delegation (5/7, 0, 2/7)**: Payoff = 25/7 ≈ 3.57

## Conclusion

Mutual delegation Pareto dominates all other equilibria, giving both players the maximum achievable payoff of 5 points. Since the mediator was specifically designed to facilitate this cooperative outcome, and delegation is a strict best response to delegation, the optimal strategy is to delegate with probability 1.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to make the optimal decision.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)**

We are playing a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a coordination game with a twist. The best outcome for both is (A0,A0) with 5 points each. But if you play A1 and the other plays A0, you get 3 (better than 0), and if both play A1, you both get 3.

Strategic features:
- A0 is better when the other plays A0.
- A1 is safe: you always get at least 3 (vs. 0 if you play A0 and other plays A1).
- (A0,A0) is the most efficient outcome (5+5 = 10), but risky because if one plays A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0.

There are **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). (A1, A1) is a "safe" equilibrium, since no player can improve by deviating unilaterally.

But there's also a mixed strategy equilibrium.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism**

Before playing, you and the other player must **approve** mediators via **approval voting**.

- There are two mediators: M1 (proposed by Player 1), M2 (proposed by Player 2).
- You can approve or disapprove each.
- The mediator with the **most approvals** wins.
- If multiple mediators tie for most approvals, **one is selected uniformly at random** from those.

Once a mediator is chosen, you can **choose to delegate** your move to it, or play independently.

But the **key point**: delegation is **not automatic**. You decide, after the mediator is selected, whether to delegate or not.

**Important note**: The approval phase is **before** the game, and it’s about selecting *which* mediator is available (and potentially used).

In other words:
1. You vote on which mediators to approve (M1, M2).
2. The mediator(s) with the most approvals are eligible.
3. One is picked at random among those.
4. Then, you and the other player decide: delegate or play independently.

So, the mediator’s rule depends on **how many players delegate to it** — but only **after** you've approved it and it is selected.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the two mediators**

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So **regardless** of how many players delegate, it always plays A0.

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

Same as M1: always plays A0.

👉 So **both mediators behave identically**.

They are **indistinguishable in action**: both play A0 no matter how many people delegate.

---

### **Step 4: What does it mean to approve a mediator?**

You approve a mediator if you want it to be eligible to be the final selected mediator.

Since both mediators do **exactly the same thing**, approval doesn't affect gameplay outcome — they are functionally the same.

But: approval voting is about **influence**. You want the mediator that helps you maximize your expected points.

But since both always play A0, the only difference is in **likelihood of being selected**.

However, since the winning mediator is selected **at random from the ones with maximum approvals**, your approval affects the **set of candidates**.

Suppose:
- You approve both → both are eligible.
- Then, since both have same number of approvals (if we both approve both), it goes to a uniform random choice between them → but since they are identical, it doesn’t matter which is chosen.
- If only one is approved, only that one is eligible → it wins for sure.

But the mediators are **identical** — so you gain **no benefit** from preferring one over the other.

---

### **Step 5: What if you delegate to a mediator?**

Suppose you delegate to a mediator → it plays A0 for you.

So your move becomes A0.

But you can also **choose to play independently**.

So the **best strategy** depends on what the other player does.

But now comes a crucial point:

If **both** players **delegate** to the **same** mediator (and that mediator plays A0), then:
- Both are playing A0 → you get 5.

But if **you delegate**, and the other **doesn’t**, then:
- You play A0 (due to mediator)
- Other player plays independently → let’s say they play A1 → you get 0 (bad)
- Or if they play A0 → you get 5.

So delegating makes you **cooperate fully** — you commit to A0.

But you only get the good payoff (5) if the other player cooperates (plays A0).

But consider: if you don’t delegate, you can choose your own action.

So **delegation is binding**: you no longer have freedom; the mediator chooses for you.

Since both mediators play A0 always, **delegating means you always play A0**.

Hence, if you delegate, you are committed to A0.

---

### **Step 6: Can you benefit from delegation?**

Let’s consider what happens if you **don’t delegate**.

Then you can play optimally: choose A0 or A1 with some probability.

Let’s look at the **equilibria** of the base game:

- (A0, A0): both get 5 → efficient, but fragile.
- (A1, A1): both get 3 → safe, no incentive to deviate.

Is it rational to play A0?

Only if you believe the other will play A0.

But if you play A0 and the other plays A1 → you get 0 → very bad.

So many might prefer to play A1 to guarantee 3.

But let’s suppose you want to **coordinate** on (A0,A0) — that gives you 5 instead of 3.

So if you could **commit to A0** (via delegation), you could **induce** the other player to play A0, since:
- If you play A0, the other gets 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1 → so they prefer A0.

Thus, **commitment to A0 can improve coordination**.

But:

- If you delegate, you **must** play A0.
- If the other doesn’t delegate, they can still play A1 → bad for you.

But if you believe the **other player is rational**, they might realize that:
- If they play A1, you play A0 → they get 3.
- If they play A0, you play A0 → they get 5.

So *if you commit to A0*, they have **incentive to play A0 too**.

So: **delegation (committing to A0) can be beneficial** if it leads the other player to also play A0.

But the other player might not delegate — they can act independently.

So even if you delegate, you only get 0 if the other plays A1.

So the **risk remains**.

But here's the key: If **both** players delegate, then **both** play A0 → you get 5.

So if both delegates and the mediator is available, outcome is (A0,A0): 5 each.

So **if both delegate**, you both get 5.

But if only one delegates, then:
- The delegate plays A0
- The other plays independently → they might play A1 → you get 0 (if you delegate)

So: **delegating is only safe if the other player also delegates**.

But what if **neither** delegates?

Then you’re back to the base game.

---

### **Step 7: You want to maximize your expected points**

You are in the **approval phase**, before delegation.

You want to **approve mediators** that help you get higher expected payoff.

But since both mediators are **identical**, it doesn't matter which one you approve.

But: **can you get more points by having the mediator in the game?**

Yes — **if the mediator enables better coordination**.

But the mediator **only acts if you delegate**.

So if you **approve a mediator**, you **make it possible** for the game to use a mediator.

Then, if you delegate, and the other also delegates, you both play A0 → get 5.

But if you don't approve any mediator, then **no mediator exists**, and you must play independently.

So **approving a mediator gives you an option** to commit to A0.

But the **best case** is when **both players delegate** to the same mediator → you get 5.

But if only one delegates → you get 0 (if other plays A1), or 5 (if other plays A0).

But if the other player is rational and knows you're committed to A0, they should play A0.

So the **rational strategy for both** might be:

- Approve a mediator (to enable commitment)
- Then, **delegate**, so you play A0
- Because the other player sees that you’re committed to A0, they play A0 → you both get 5.

So if **both players do this**, you both get 5.

If only one approves and delegates, the outcome depends.

But crucially: **you don’t know what the other player will do**.

However, since the mediators are **identical**, approving or not approving doesn’t cost you anything.

And approving gives you the **option** to commit to A0 via delegation.

So if you **don’t approve any mediator**, you **cannot delegate** — you must play independently.

But in the base game, the Nash equilibrium is (A1,A1) with 3 points each.

But if you **can commit to A0** (via delegation), you can get 5 — if the other cooperates.

But you must go through the approval process.

So: **approving a mediator gives you a chance to escape the safe but suboptimal (A1,A1) equilibrium**.

Therefore, **you should approve mediators** to keep the possibility of coordination open.

But since both M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn’t matter which one you approve.

So you should approve **both**.

Why?

- If you approve only one, and the other player approves both, the set of candidates is both → random selection → no problem.
- But if you approve neither, then **no mediator** is available → you cannot delegate → you are forced into base game → possibly (A1,A1) → 3 points.
- But if you approve at least one, you have the **option** to delegate → which allows you to get 5 if coordination is possible.

So **approving at least one mediator is beneficial**.

But since both do the same thing, **approving both** doesn’t hurt.

In fact:

- If you approve both, then **any global approval set that includes at least one** will include both in the eligible set (if they are tied).
- The random selection is still fair.

Moreover, if the other player also approves both, then both are eligible → still fine.

If you approve only one, but the other approves both, then M2 might be selected, but it’s identical.

So **no downside** to approving both.

But is there a **risk**?

Suppose you approve **only** M1. The other player approves only M2. Then:
- M1 has 1 approval
- M2 has 1 approval
- Both tied → selected at random → you get either M1 or M2 → both play A0 → so no harm.

But if you approve **both**, you **increase the chance** that the mediator is available.

In fact, **the more mediators you approve**, the **more likely** your preferred mediator (or any) is **available**.

Even though both are identical, approving both **increases the probability** that **at least one** is selected, assuming the other player approves appropriately.

But actually: the winning mediator is **selected from the ones with maximum approvals**.

So if **you approve both**, and the other approves only one, say M1, then:
- M1: 2 approvals (you + other)
- M2: 1 approval (only you)
- → M1 has max (2), wins

So M1 is chosen → you can delegate to it.

If you **approved only M1**, and other approved only M2:
- M1: 1
- M2: 1
- → both tied → one selected at random → either M1 or M2 → both play A0 → same result.

But **chance of having a mediator at all** is higher if you approve both.

In fact: **even if the other approves nothing**, if you approve both, then:
- M1: 1, M2: 1 → both tied → one selected at random → a mediator exists → you can choose to delegate.

But if you approve **only one**, and the other approves none:
- Then only that one has 1 approval → wins → still exists.

So **as long as you approve at least one**, **a mediator will be selected** (unless others approve none and you approve one — still fine).

But if you approve **none**, then **no mediator** is selected → no delegation possible → back to base game.

So the **risk** of not approving any is: **you lose the option to delegate**, which might prevent coordination on (A0,A0).

Therefore, to **maximize your chance of getting 5**, you should **approve at least one**.

But since both mediators are **identical**, approving both gives you **no disadvantage**, and doesn’t reduce your chance of having a mediator.

In fact, it **increases** the robustness: even if the other player approves only one, you still have a chance to get the mediator.

But more importantly: **since both are the same**, there is no cost to approving both.

Therefore, **you should approve both**.

---

### **Step 8: Final decision**

Both mediators are identical: always play A0.

Approving them gives you the **option** to delegate, which can help you coordinate on (A0,A0) and get 5 instead of 3.

Not approving any removes that option.

So **approving both is strictly better** than approving only one or none.

Thus, **you should approve both M1 and M2**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### Understanding the Payoff Matrix
We start by analyzing the payoff matrix for the game:
- If both you and the other player choose A0, both get 5 points.
- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1, you get 0 points, and they get 3 points.
- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0, you get 3 points, and they get 0 points.
- If both choose A1, both get 3 points.

#### Analyzing the Mediator Option
The mediator plays A0 if someone delegates. If both delegate, the mediator still plays A0. The mediator strategy does not change regardless of how many players delegate.

#### Evaluating Strategies
We’re Player 2. Let's look at our potential actions and outcomes considering the mediator:

1. **If we choose A0**:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: We get 5 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: We get 0 points.
   - If Player 1 delegates (assuming mediator): We get 5 points (because mediator plays A0).
   
2. **If we choose A1**:
   - If Player 1 chooses A0: We get 3 points.
   - If Player 1 chooses A1: We get 3 points.
   - If Player 1 delegates: We get 3 points (because mediator plays A0).

3. **If we delegate to the mediator**:
   - Mediator plays A0:
     - If Player 1 chooses A0: We get 5 points.
     - If Player 1 chooses A1: We get 0 points.
     - If Player 1 also delegates: We get 5 points.

#### Strategic Considerations
To maximize our points, we need to consider the possible strategies of Player 1:
1. **Trusting cooperation**:
   - Both delegate to mediator, leading to both playing A0.
   - Result: Both get 5 points.
   
2. **Mixed Strategy Evaluation**:
   - If Player 1 is likely to play A1, we should avoid A0 and consider mixing between A1 and delegating.
   
Given Player 1's payoffs:
- If Player 1 thinks we will choose A0, they may choose A1 to get 3 points (leaving us with 0).
- If Player 1 thinks we will choose A1, they might prefer A0 to potentially trick us into a lower payoff.
- If both delegate, we guarantee 5 points each.

#### Choosing Optimal Probabilities
Given:
- Delegating to the mediator removes variability and guarantees best mutual outcome (both get 5 points).
- Acting independently introduces risk.

Aiming for maximizing expected points:
- Delegate frequently to the mediator for guaranteed positive outcomes.
- Keep a smaller probability for choosing A1 in case Player 1 prefers direct play.

### Final Strategy

Given the mediator's consistent choice of A0, best strategy:
1. High probability for delegating (A2).
2. Some probability for A1 to hedge against direct play by Player 1.

#### JSON Output
```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 10, "A2": 90}
```
This implies:
- 0% for A0 (because if another strategy is better, we avoid default).
- 10% for A1 (as a minor risk/reward adjustment).
- 90% for delegating (ensuring stable, high points).

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

We are in a simultaneous-move game with two actions: **A0** and **A1**.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a variant of the **Battle of the Sexes** or **Stag Hunt**-like game, but with asymmetry in payoffs.

Let’s analyze the Nash equilibria.

- **(A0, A0)**: Both get 5 → a strong mutual cooperation.
- **(A1, A1)**: Both get 3 → stable, but worse than (A0,A0).
- **(A0, A1)**: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3 → P1 would prefer to deviate.
- **(A1, A0)**: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0 → P2 would prefer to deviate.

So (A0, A0) is a pure Nash equilibrium.
(A1, A1) is also a pure Nash equilibrium (since neither wants to unilaterally change).
Mixed strategies exist too, but let’s keep this in mind.

But **we are not playing the base game directly** — we have the **option to delegate** to mediators, and **approval voting** will choose which mediator is used.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

- You can either:
  - **Act independently**, choosing a probability distribution over A0 and A1.
  - Or **delegate** your move to a mediator.

- Players decide **simultaneously** whether to delegate or not.

- Then, **mediators are selected via approval voting**:
  - Each player approves some mediators (possibly none or all).
  - The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

- The mediator then plays on your behalf, **based on how many players delegated to it** (1 or 2), according to its rules.

> **Crucial: You don’t get to choose which mediator is used — only which ones you approve. The one used is a random one among the most-approved**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Mediators**

#### **Mediator M1 (Proposed by Player 1):**
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A0**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

So regardless of how many delegate, **M1 always plays A0**.

#### **Mediator M2 (Proposed by Player 2):**
- If **1 player** delegates → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → plays **A0**

So:
- If only you delegate → M2 plays A1
- If both players delegate → M2 plays A0

---

### **Step 4: Your Objective**

Maximize **your own expected points** in the game.

You are **Player 1**. The other player is **Player 2**.

You get to **approve or disapprove** mediators M1 and M2.

The **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So, for example:
- If you approve M1, and Player 2 approves only M2 → M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 approval → both tied → random winner (50% chance of M1, 50% M2).
- If you approve M1 and M2, and Player 2 approves only M2 → M1:1, M2:2 → M2 wins.
- If both approve M1 and M2 → both have 2 approvals → random winner.

---

### **Step 5: What Would You Gain by Delegation?**

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, possibly by coordinating with the other player via the mediator.

But you **cannot control which mediator is selected** — only your **approval vector** affects the outcome.

Let’s consider the **strategic implications** of each mediator:

#### **M1 (always A0)**:
- Forces you to play A0, regardless of delegator count.
- If you delegate to M1, you play A0.
- This is safe, but might not be optimal if you want to play A1.

#### **M2 (1-delegate → A1; 2-delegate → A0)**:
- If you are the **only delegate**, you get A1.
- If **both** delegate, you get A0.
- So if you delegate individually, you can get A1 (which is better than A0 when opponent plays A0), but if opponent also delegates, you both get A0.

---

### **Step 6: Consider Outcomes Under Different Delegation Scenarios**

Let’s consider what happens when you **approve** or **disapprove** mediators, and how your approval affects the final mediator selected, and your payoff.

We need to **design a strategy** that maximizes **your expected payoff**, assuming the other player also acts rationally (we don’t know their strategy, so we must anticipate best responses and equilibria).

But since we’re only choosing approvals (not actions), we must **choose approval sets** so that **if a mediator wins**, it leads to a high payoff for us, **in equilibrium**.

Let’s consider all possible **approval configurations**.

---

#### **Assumption: Player 2 is rational and self-interested too**

So Player 2 will also approve mediators to maximize their **own** expected points.

We are to pick our approvals (M1 and M2), and Player 2 will pick their own (we don’t know it), but we must assume they will act to maximize their payoff.

We need to **choose which mediators to approve** so that, **in equilibrium**, we do well.

Let’s try to **analyze optimal approval strategies**.

---

### **Try Strategy: Approve M1 only**

So you approve M1, disapprove M2.

Now, you want to know: what will Player 2 do?

Player 2 (P2) wants to maximize *their* payoff.

P2 can also approve or disapprove M1 and M2.

Suppose Player 2 approves **only M2**.

Then:
- M1: 1 approval (only you)
- M2: 1 approval (only P2)
→ Tied → random mediator → 50% M1, 50% M2

So you get:
- 50% chance: M1 → you play A0
- 50% chance: M2 → you play A1 if P2 does not delegate to M2

Wait — **we need to know: who delegates?**

We are not yet deciding who delegates.

The delegation and approval decisions are **separate**.

But the **mediator’s action** depends on **how many players delegate to it**.

So the process is:

1. You and P2 **simultaneously choose approvals** (what we’re deciding).
2. Then, based on approvals, a mediator is chosen (random among max-approved).
3. Then, **you and P2 simultaneously decide** whether to **delegate** to the chosen mediator or act independently.
4. Then, the mediator (if used) acts based on how many delegated.
5. Payoffs are computed.

Yes — the **delegation decision happens after** the mediator is selected.

Important: The **mediator is chosen based on approvals**, **before** delegation choices.

But the chosen mediator’s behavior depends on how many players actually delegate to it.

So **you and the other player choose delegation after knowing the mediator**.

That’s a key detail.

---

### **Sequence of Events Recap:**

1. You and P2 **simultaneously approve** a set of mediators (you choose M1/M2 approvals).
2. The **winning mediator** is selected: uniform at random from those with **maximum approvals**.
3. Then, you and P2 **simultaneously decide** whether to:
   - Delegate to the winning mediator
   - Act independently (choose your own probabilities over A0/A1)
4. If you delegate, the mediator plays as per its rule (based on # of delegators).
5. Payoffs are computed.

---

### **Now, Strategy: What should you approve?**

Let’s consider what happens **after** the winning mediator is chosen.

Suppose **M1 is chosen** (always A0).

Then you and P2 each decide to delegate or act independently.

But if you **delegate**, you **must play A0**, because that’s what M1 does regardless.

If you act independently, you can choose any mix.

But **M1 is always A0**, so if you delegate, you get A0.

Similarly, if **M2 is chosen**, then:
- If only one player delegates → that player gets A1
- If both delegate → both get A0

So M2 is **incentive-compatible only if both players are happy to play A0 when both delegate**.

Now, let’s compare the possible outcomes.

Let’s suppose you **approve both M1 and M2**.

Then, regardless of what P2 does, **you can be sure that at least one of them has your approval**.

But to **maximize chances of a good mediator**, you want **max approval**.

Let’s consider:

> You want to **increase the chance** that a favorable mediator is selected.

But what is favorable?

Let’s suppose you **approve only M1**.

Then P2 can choose to approve M1 or M2.

If P2 approves M1, then M1 has 2 approvals → M1 wins.

If P2 approves M2 only, then M1:1, M2:1 → random.

If P2 approves both, then M1:2, M2:2 → random.

So **if you approve only M1**, and P2 approves both → tie → random.

So **M1 could still win**.

But now, if M1 wins:

- It always plays A0 → so if you delegate, you get A0.
- If you act independently, you could play A1, but if both players act independently, you get:
   - If both play A1: (3,3)
   - If you play A1, P2 plays A0: (3,0)
   - If you play A0, P2 plays A1: (0,3)
   - If both A0: (5,5)

But if you delegate to M1, you are forced to A0.

So if M1 is chosen, **what’s best for you**?

Let’s suppose M1 is chosen.

Then you and P2 decide whether to delegate or not.

You want to choose a strategy (delegate or not, and if not, what mix) to maximize your payoff.

But P2 is selfish.

So you must model this **subgame**.

Let’s do that.

---

### **Subgame: Mediator M1 is chosen (always plays A0)**

You and P2 choose independently whether to **delegate** to M1 or act independently.

- If you delegate → you play A0
- If you act independently → you can choose a mix

But M1 just plays A0 regardless of who delegates, so your choice of delegating only affects **your own action**, not the others’.

Let’s suppose:
- You delegate → you play A0
- P2 delegates → P2 plays A0
- You act independently → you can choose A0 or A1
- P2 acts independently → chooses their own strategy

So payoffs depend on your choices.

Let’s suppose both act independently.

Can you get better than A0?

Suppose you choose to play A1 with probability p.

P2 chooses to play A1 with probability q.

Then:
- P1 gets 5 if (A0,A0)
- P1 gets 0 if (A0,A1)
- P1 gets 3 if (A1,A0)
- P1 gets 3 if (A1,A1)

So your expected payoff is:

E1 = 5·P(A0, A0) + 0·P(A0, A1) + 3·P(A1, A0) + 3·P(A1, A1)

= 5·(1−p)(1−q) + 0·(1−p)q + 3·p(1−q) + 3·p q

= 5(1−p)(1−q) + 3p(1−q) + 3p q

= 5(1−p−q+pq) + 3p − 3p q + 3p q

= 5 - 5p - 5q + 5pq + 3p

= 5 - 2p - 5q + 5pq

Now, if you **delegate**, you play A0 → p = 0.

Then E1 = 5 - 0 - 5q + 0 = 5(1−q)

Similarly, if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose p to maximize E1.

But P2 also chooses q to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s find best response.

Suppose you delegate → p=0 → you get 5(1−q)

P2 wants to maximize: their payoff is 5 if (A0,A0), 0 if (A1,A0), 3 if (A0,A1), 3 if (A1,A1)

So P2’s expected payoff if they act independently:

E2 = 5(1−p)(1−q) + 3(1−p)q + 0·p(1−q) + 3·p q

= 5(1−p)(1−q) + 3(1−p)q + 3p q

= 5(1−p−q+pq) + 3q − 3p q + 3p q

= 5 - 5p - 5q + 5pq + 3q

= 5 - 5p - 2q + 5pq

Now, if you delegate (p=0), your payoff: 5(1−q)
P2 wants to minimize q? No — wait, P2 wants to **maximize** their payoff.

So if p=0, then E2 = 5 − 5(0) − 2q + 0 = 5 − 2q

To maximize, P2 wants to **minimize q**, so set q=0.

Then P2 gets 5.

You get 5(1−0) = 5.

So if you delegate to M1, and P2 acts independently, P2 will choose q=0 → A0 → so you both get (A0,A0).

So you get 5.

But if you don’t delegate, you could choose p.

Suppose you choose p=1 (play A1 always).

Then E1 = 5 - 2(1) - 5q + 5(1)q = 5 - 2 - 5q + 5q = 3.

You get 3.

If you choose p=0 → you get 5(1−q)

If you choose p=0.5 → E1 = 5 - 2(0.5) -5q + 5(0.5)q = 5 -1 -5q + 2.5q = 4 - 2.5q

To maximize, you'd want q small → so P2 will set q=0 → you get 4.

Better than 3, but worse than 5.

Wait — can you get **more than 5**?

No, maximum is 5.

So if you delegate → p=0 → you get 5(1−q)

P2 will minimize q → set q=0 → so you get 5.

If you **don’t delegate**, even if P2 plays A0, you can get up to 5 if you play A0.

But if you play A1, you get only 3 (if P2 plays A0).

So best pure strategy for you: **if M1 is chosen, you should delegate**, because:
- If you delegate, you get A0 → and P2 will play A0 → you get 5.
- If you don't delegate, you could get less.

Even if you play A0 independently, you get 5 only if P2 plays A0 → but P2 will, because if they deviate to A1, they get only 3.

So if you act independently and play A0, you get 5 — same as delegating.

But **you can't guarantee** you'll play A0 — you might play A1.

But if you **delegate**, you are **forced** to A0.

And P2 will play A0 → so you get 5.

So **if M1 is chosen, best thing for you is to delegate** → guaranteed 5.

Similarly, P2 will also want to delegate? Let's see.

If P2 delegates → P2 plays A0.

P2's payoff: 5 if P1 plays A0.

But P1 is rational.

So if M1 is chosen, and you delegate, P2 will play A0 → so P2 gets 5.

If P2 doesn't delegate, P2 can play A0 → also gets 5.

But if P2 plays A1, they get 0 if you play A0.

So P2 will play A0.

So both get 5.

So **if M1 is chosen, both players will likely delegate or play A0**, and **you can guarantee 5**.

So **M1 is good for you**.

Now consider **M2**.

M2:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

Let’s suppose **M2 is chosen**.

Now you and P2 decide whether to delegate or act independently.

Let’s analyze best response.

Suppose **you delegate** → you play A1 **if only one delegates**, or A0 **if two delegate**.

But you don’t know how many will delegate.

Suppose **both delegate** → M2 plays A0 → so both play A0 → you get 5.

If **only you delegate** → M2 plays A1 → you play A1.

Then P2 plays independently.

P2’s action: they can choose to play A0 or A1.

If you play A1, and P2 plays A0 → you get 3, they get 0.

If you play A1, P2 plays A1 → both get 3.

So P2 will prefer to play A1 (get 3) rather than A0 (get 0).

So if you play A1 and P2 acts independently, P2 will play A1 → both get 3.

But if P2 delegates, they play A0 → you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0 → P2 will not want that.

So P2 will **not delegate** if you delegate, because:
- If they delegate → they play A0 → get only 3 if you play A1, but wait: if both delegate, M2 plays A0 → both get 3.
- If you delegate and P2 delegates → both get A0 → payoff 3 each.

If you delegate and P2 **does not delegate** → P2 can choose to play A1 (since you play A1) → both get 3.

So same payoff.

But if P2 delegates, they play A0, then you play A1 → (A1, A0): you get 3, P2 gets 0.

But if P2 plays A1, and you play A1 → both get 3.

So P2 will **prefer to play A1 independently** rather than delegate (which forces A0 and gives them 0).

So P2 will **not delegate** if you delegate.

Thus, if you delegate, P2 will play A1 independently → you play A1 → both get 3.

Now, what if **you do not delegate**?

Then you can choose your own action.

Suppose you play A0.

Then P2 can choose to delegate or not.

If P2 delegates → M2 plays A1 → P2 plays A1.

You play A0 → (A0, A1): you get 0, P2 gets 3.

If P2 does not delegate → P2 can choose what to play.

If P2 plays A0 → you get 5.

If P2 plays A1 → you get 0.

So P2 will play A1 → get 3 > 0.

So P2 will not delegate (because that forces A1, but they can do better by acting).

P2 will play A1 independently.

So if you play A0, P2 plays A1 → you get 0.

Worse.

Suppose you play A1.

Then P2 can:
- Delegate → plays A1 → both play A1 → both get 3.
- Not delegate → plays A1 → both get 3.

Same outcome.

But if P2 plays A0 → they get 0 → so they won’t.

So P2 plays A1.

Both get 3.

So **if you do not delegate and play A1**, you get 3.

Now compare:
- If you delegate → P2 plays A1 → you get 3
- If you don't delegate and play A1 → you get 3
- If you don’t delegate and play A0 → you get 0

So best for you is to **not delegate and play A1**, get 3.

But wait — you **can** get 3.

But earlier, if M1 is chosen, you can get 5.

So **M2 is worse for you** than M1.

Can you get 5 with M2?

Only if both play A0.

But if one delegate to M2, they get A1 (if only one delegates).

So if you delegate, you get A1 (if P2 doesn’t delegate) → you get 3.

If both delegate → both get A0 → you get 5.

But P2 will only play A0 if they delegate → but if they delegate, they get A0.

But if they don’t delegate, they can play A0 or A1.

But if they can play A0 independently, they get 5 (if you play A0), or 3 (if you play A1).

So if you are playing A0, P2 prefers to play A0 (get 5).

But if you are playing A1, P2 prefers to play A1 (get 3).

So to get A0 from P2, you need to make them want to play A0.

Only if you play A0, P2 wants to play A0.

But if you play A0, and P2 delegates, they play A0 → both get 5.

But if you play A0 and P2 doesn’t delegate, P2 can play A0 → also get 5.

So P2 is indifferent.

But if you delegate (to M2), you get A1, not A0.

So **the only way to get 5 is if you both play A0**.

But if you delegate, you play A1 (if only one delegates), or A0 (if both).

But P2 won’t delegate, because if you delegate and they don’t, you play A1, they play A1 → both get 3.

If they delegate, they play A0 → you play A1 → they get 0 → worse.

So **P2 will never delegate** if you delegate.

Thus, if you delegate, P2 plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 3.

If you **don’t delegate**, and you play A0, P2 will play A1 → you get 0.

If you play A1, P2 plays A1 → you get 3.

So **best for you with M2**: play A1 independently → get 3.

You cannot get 5.

But if M1 is chosen, you can get 5.

So **M1 is strictly better than M2 for you**.

---

### **Now, back to approval phase**

You want to **increase the chance** that **M1 is selected**, or at least **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s suppose you **approve M1 only**.

Then depending on P2’s approval:

- If P2 approves M1 → M1 has 2 approvals → M1 wins
- If P2 approves M2 only → M1:1, M2:1 → random → 50% M1, 50% M2
- If P2 approves both → M1:1, M2:1 → random

So in all cases, **M1 wins with at least 50% chance**.

But if P2 approves only M2, and you approve only M1 → tied → random.

Now, if M1 wins → you get 5 (as shown)
If M2 wins → you get 3 (as shown, best is 3)

So expected payoff if you approve M1 and P2 approves M2 only:

= 0.5 × 5 + 0.5 × 3 = 2.5 + 1.5 = **4**

Now, suppose you **approve both M1 and M2**.

Then your approval set is {M1, M2}.

Now, if P2 approves only M2 → M1:1, M2:2 → M2 wins → you get 3

If P2 approves only M1 → M1:2, M2:1 → M1 wins → you get 5

If P2 approves both → both have 2 approvals → random → 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4

So depending on P2:

- If P2 approves only M1: you get 5
- If P2 approves only M2: you get 3
- If P2 approves both: you get 4

What will P2 do?

P2 wants to **maximize their own payoff**.

So let’s see what P2 wants.

P2 prefers M1 or M2?

Let’s analyze P2’s expected payoff in each case.

But we don’t know your strategy.

But assume that if **M1 is chosen**, P2 can get 5 (by delegating or playing A0).

If **M2 is chosen**, what can P2 get?

If M2 is chosen:

- If P2 delegates → plays A1 (if only one delegates) or A0 (if both)
- If P2 doesn’t delegate → plays independently

Suppose P2 wants to maximize their payoff.

If M2 is chosen, and P2 delegates:

- If only P2 delegates → M2 plays A1 → P2 gets A1
- Then you (P1) can choose to play A0 or A1.

If P1 plays A0 → (A0, A1): P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
If P1 plays A1 → both get 3

So P1 will play A1 → so P2 gets 3

If both delegate → M2 plays A0 → both play A0 → P2 gets 5

But P1 will not delegate (because if P1 delegates, they get A1 if only one delegates → gets 3, worse than 5)

So P1 will not delegate.

So if P2 delegates and P1 does not, P2 gets A1, P1 gets A1 → both get 3

If P2 does not delegate, they can play A1 → same.

Or play A0 → get only 0 (if P1 plays A1).

So P2 will play A1 → get 3.

But if P2 **does not delegate**, and plays A1, they get 3.

Same as delegating.

But if P2 delegates, they get **forced A1** if only one delegates.

But same outcome.

But if **both delegate**, both get A0 → P2 gets 5.

But P1 will only delegate if it benefits them.

But with M2, if P1 delegates, they get A1 → get 3, which is less than 5.

So P1 will not delegate.

So **P1 will not delegate to M2**.

So **only P2 delegates → M2 plays A1 → P2 gets 3**

If P2 does not delegate → can play A1 → same.

So best P2 can get with M2: 3.

But with M1: 5.

So P2 **prefers M1**.

Therefore, **P2 will approve M1** if possible.

Because if M1 is chosen, P2 can get 5.

If M2 is chosen, only 3.

So P2 will **want M1 to be selected**.

So likely, **P2 will approve M1**.

Similarly, if you approve M1, and P2 approves M1, then M1 has 2 approvals (if you both approve M1) → M1 wins.

If you approve only M1, P2 approves M1 → M1 wins → you get 5.

If you approve both, P2 approves M1 → M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins → you get 5.

If you approve neither, M1 has 0, M2 has 1 (if P2 approves M2), M2 wins → you get 3.

But you don’t want that.

So **best for you is to approve M1**, and **since P2 prefers M1**, they will approve it.

So likely, M1 wins.

Now, what if you approve M2?

If you approve M2, but not M1, and P2 approves M1, then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 → random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → you get 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4

But if you approve M1 and M2, and P2 approves M1, then M1 wins (2 approvals), you get 5.

Similarly, if you approve only M1, same.

So approval of M2 **does not help**, and might **hurt** if P2 doesn’t approve it.

But P2 will not approve M2, because M2 gives them only 3.

So if you approve M2, but P2 doesn't, and you approve M1, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → random → you get 4.

But if you **don’t approve M2**, and approve only M1, and P2 approves M1, then M1 wins → you get 5.

So **better to approve only M1**.

Therefore, your best strategy is:

- Approve **only M1** → M1 wins with probability 1 (since P2 approves M1)
- You get 5
- No gain from approving M2

Also, if you approve M2, and P2 approves M1, you risk 50% M2 → worse payoff.

So **do not approve M2**.

---

### **Final Decision**

- **Approve M1**: Yes → gives you 5
- **Approve M2**: No → gives you less in expectation

Even though M2 might seem good (can play A1 if only one delegates), it leads to **lower payoff for you** because P2 won’t delegate to it, and you can’t coordinate to get 5.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry


Your previous response was:
Let's analyze the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)

We are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):

|         | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)** | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **A1 (P2)** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

So, in the base game, each player wants to coordinate on (A0, A0) for mutual benefit (5 each), but if only one person plays A0 and the other A1, the one playing A1 gets 3 while the one playing A0 gets 0.

However, playing A1 against A0 gives you 3, and playing A1 against A1 gives you 3 — so A1 is never worse than A0 against A1, and A1 is better than A0 against A0? Wait — no.

Wait: You are Player 2.

Let’s reorganize the payoffs from **Player 2's perspective** (you):

- If you play A0:
  - P1 plays A0 → you get 5
  - P1 plays A1 → you get 0

- If you play A1:
  - P1 plays A0 → you get 3
  - P1 plays A1 → you get 3

So from your perspective:
- A0 gives you 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1
- A1 gives you 3 regardless of what P1 does

So playing A1 is **never worse** than A0 — in fact, it guarantees 3, while A0 can give you 0.

So A1 is **weakly dominant** for you.

In fact, the Nash equilibria of the base game:
- (A1, A1): both get 3 → no incentive to deviate
- (A0, A0): both get 5 → but if you think P1 will play A0, you get 5 vs 3 if you switch to A1 → so (A0,A0) is unstable

Actually, let’s compute best responses.

For you (Player 2):
- If P1 plays A0 → you best respond with A0 (5 > 3)
- If P1 plays A1 → you best respond with A1 (3 = 3, so indifferent, but A1 is safe)

So your best response:
- To A0: A0
- To A1: A1 (indifferent, but A1 doesn't risk 0)

But if you assume P1 is rational, then P1 will not want to play A0 if you play A1 (since P1 gets 0), so P1 wants to play A1 if you play A1.

Wait — P1’s payoffs (same matrix):

- P1 plays A0:
  - You (P2) play A0 → P1 gets 5
  - You play A1 → P1 gets 0 → bad
- P1 plays A1:
  - You play A0 → P1 gets 3
  - You play A1 → P1 gets 3 → always 3

So for P1, playing A1 is also weakly dominant:
- If you play A0 → P1 gets 0 if plays A0, 3 if plays A1 → so better to play A1
- If you play A1 → P1 gets 3 either way

So both players have A1 as weakly dominant strategy.

Therefore, the only **Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), where both get 3.

So in the base game, **rational players will end up at (A1, A1)** → you get 3.

But there is a **Pareto-dominant outcome**: (A0, A0), where you both get 5. But neither player has incentive to unilaterally play A0, since they risk getting 0.

So the outcome is inefficient: both get 3 when they could get 5.

---

### Step 2: Mediator system

Now each player can **delegate** their move to a mediator.

You get to **approve** mediators, and the mediator with **most approvals** wins (chosen uniformly at random if tie).

The proposed mediators:
- M1: Proposed by Player 1
- M2: Proposed by Player 2

**Both mediators have identical behavior**:
> If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1  
> If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

So both mediators behave the **same way**.

We are to decide: Which mediators do we approve?

You are Player 2.

We need to decide whether to approve M1 or M2, or both, or neither.

But since both mediators have **identical behavior**, they are **strategically equivalent**.

So, if we approve both, then both M1 and M2 will have the same number of approvals (assuming the other player approves one or both).

But **the final mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

So if you approve both, and the other player approves one, then you both have 1 approval → so both are tied for max → pick one at random → you have 50% chance of getting M1, 50% M2 — but since both are identical, it doesn't matter.

If you approve one (say M1), and the other player approves the same, they also have 1 ap, so tie → random choice.

If you approve both, and the other approves both, then both have 2 approvals → still random → but since both are identical, outcome is same.

If you approve both, but the other approves only one (say M1), then M1 has 2 approvals (you + P1), M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

But since both mediators play the same, **the outcome doesn’t depend on which mediator wins**.

So the only thing that matters is **who ends up being the mediator**, and since both behave identically, it doesn't matter.

Therefore, the **behavior of the system depends only on the total number of delegations**, not on which mediator is picked.

Let’s define:

Let D be the number of players who delegate to the mediator: 0, 1, or 2.

- If 0 delegate → both play independently → go back to base game → equilibrium at (A1, A1) → you get 3
- If 1 delegates → the mediator plays A1 → so the delegating player's action is A1, the non-delegating player chooses their own action
- If 2 delegate → the mediator plays A0 → so both players play A0 → you get 5

So the outcome depends on delegation.

Now, the **mediator only acts when someone delegates**, and its behavior depends on how many delegates.

But the key: both mediators behave the same.

So you should always **approve mediators that have the same behavior**, unless there's a strategic reason not to.

In fact, if it doesn’t matter which mediator is used (they are identical), and you want to **maximize your chance of getting a good outcome**, then you want to:
- Ensure the mediator **can be chosen** if desired
- Especially since you can’t control the other player’s choice

Now, **important**: you are choosing which mediators to approve, and the **winning mediator is the one with the most approvals** (random if tie).

So if you **don’t approve any**, then the mediator is not available → no delegation possible → you are forced to act independently → outcome is (A1, A1) → 3 points.

But if you **approve at least one**, and the other player also approves at least one, then it's possible for delegation to occur.

Let’s consider possible outcomes.

But here's the key insight:

> You want to **increase the chance that both players delegate** → because if both delegate, **mediator plays A0** → both get 5 → better for you.

> But if only one delegates, mediator plays A1 → so one player plays A1 → the other plays independently.

Now, **what will the non-delegating player do?**

They are playing independently, and for them, A1 is weakly dominant, so they will play A1.

So:
- If only **one player delegates**: the delegate plays A1 (per mediator rules), the non-delegate plays A1 (rationally) → both play A1 → you get 3.

- If **both delegate**: both play A0 → you get 5.

- If **neither delegates**: both play independently → both play A1 (since A1 weakly dominant) → you get 3.

So the **only way to get 5 points** is if **both players delegate**.

Thus, your point outcome:
- 5 if both delegate
- 3 if 0 or 1 delegate

So to maximize your expected payoff, you want to **maximize the probability that both delegate**.

But delegation only happens if the mediator is available — i.e., if **at least one player approves** the winning mediator.

So if you don’t approve any mediator, then no mediator is available → no delegation → both act independently → both play A1 → you get 3.

So never choosing delegation leads to 3.

But if you approve a mediator, you open the possibility of delegation.

Now, the other player is also deciding whom to approve.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own points.

We are Player 2.

Let’s think about incentives.

Suppose **you approve both mediators**.

Then:
- The other player also wants to get 5 points → so they want *both* to delegate → so they will try to ensure that the mediator is available and that they can coordinate on delegation.

But there’s a catch: if only one of the mediators is approved, then even if both approve it, then it can win.

But if both mediators are approved by both players, then both have 2 approvals → tie → pick uniformly at random → mediator selected → then both delegate → A0 → you get 5.

But suppose you approve only one mediator (say M1), and the other player approves only M1 → then M1 wins → both delegate → A0 → you get 5.

Same if you approve only M1 and they approve M2 → then M1 and M2 each have 1 approval → tie → random selection → say M1 wins → both delegate → A0.

So in all cases, **if both players approve at least one mediator (possibly different ones), then it’s possible for a mediator to be selected** — and **if both people delegate**, then both get A0 → 5.

But here’s the catch: do both players actually want to delegate?

Let’s think about **individual incentives to delegate**.

Suppose you approve a mediator (say M1), and assume the mediator will be chosen (either because only one is approved, or tied).

Now, **will you delegate**?

Let’s analyze:

You are deciding whether to delegate or not.

If you delegate:
- You get whatever the mediator plays, depending on how many delegate.

But you alone decide to delegate — the other player may not.

So you need to consider the other player’s choice.

But we can think about **dominance**.

Let’s suppose you **do not delegate**.

Then:
- The mediator chooses what you do.
- But no, if you don’t delegate, you choose your own action.

So possibilities:

Case 1: You **don’t delegate**, and the other player **does delegate** → follows the mediator.

Then, since only one player delegates → mediator plays A1 → the delegator plays A1 → you (Player 2) play independently.

You will play A1 (dominant strategy), so resulting actions: A1 (you), A1 (other) → you get 3.

Case 2: You **don’t delegate**, and the other player **doesn’t delegate** → both play independently → A1 vs A1 → you get 3.

Case 3: You **do delegate**, and the other player **doesn’t delegate** → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A1 → you get 3.

Case 4: You **do delegate**, and the other player **does delegate** → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → other plays A0 → you get 5.

So your payoff depends on whether **both** delegate.

But **you can only control your own delegation**, not the other player’s.

So if you don’t delegate, you get 3 regardless.

If you **do delegate**, you get 3 unless the other player also delegates → in which case you get 5.

So **you get a higher payoff if both delegate** → but you can't control the other player.

So you might be afraid of delegating: if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get A1 (3) — same as not delegating.

If you delegate and the other does, you get 5 → better.

But if you don’t delegate, you never get more than 3.

So **you have a strategic incentive to delegate — but only if you expect the other to delegate as well**.

But there’s a coordination issue.

However, here’s a key: you are **choosing which mediator to approve** — and you can **influence the probability** that the mediator is available.

But you don’t control the other player.

But the **mediator is chosen from those approved** — so to **maximize the chance of delegation**, you want the mediator to be **available**, because if no mediator is available, delegation can’t happen.

So if you **do not approve any mediator**, then no mediation is possible → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 3.

If you **approve at least one mediator**, then as long as the other player also approves at least one, **there will be a mediator chosen**, so delegation is possible.

But can you **force** both players to delegate?

No — but you can **increase the chance** that delegation occurs.

However, **each player must decide whether to delegate**, and they only benefit if both delegate.

So unless there’s a way to **coordinate** on delegation, it may not happen.

But here’s the insight: **if both players approve at least one mediator, then a mediator is available → so delegation is possible.**

Then, if **both players expect the other to delegate**, they might both delegate and get 5.

But is delegation a best response?

Yes — if you think the other player will delegate, then:
- If you delegate → you get 5
- If you don’t → you get 3 (since other player plays A1 via delegation or independently?)

Wait — if the other player delegates, they play A1 if only one delegates.

But if both delegate, the mediator plays A0.

So suppose you believe the other player will delegate.

Then:
- If you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate → only one delegates (the other player) → mediator plays A1 → other player plays A1 → you play independently → you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3

So **you strictly prefer to delegate** if you expect the other to delegate.

Similarly, the other player has the same incentive.

So if **both believe the other will delegate**, then both want to delegate → (delegation, delegation) is a Nash equilibrium in the delegation stage.

But there’s also a **pure strategy equilibrium** where **neither delegates**:
- If you don’t delegate, and the other doesn’t → you get 3
- If you deviate and delegate, you risk getting 3 (if other doesn't delegate) instead of 3 → no benefit

But if others don’t delegate, then:
- If you unilaterally delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A1 → you get 3
- Same as not delegating → so indifferent

But if the other player doesn’t delegate, and you delegate → you get 3 (same as if you didn’t).

So you are indifferent.

But if you **can** coordinate on both delegating, you both get 5 → better than 3.

So the **only way to get more than 3** is to **both delegate**.

But delegation is only possible if **a mediator is available**.

So for delegation to be possible, at least one mediator must be approved by **some player**.

The **only way delegation can happen** is if **at least one mediator is approved by at least one player**.

But even then, delegation **depends on both players actually choosing to delegate**.

So now, the best strategy for you is:

- Approve **at least one mediator**, so that delegation is possible → then if the other player also approves, and both players can coordinate on delegation, you both get 5.

- If you **don’t approve any**, then no mediator → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 3.

Since 5 > 3, you **prefer** the possibility of 5.

So you **must** approve **at least one**.

Now, which ones?

M1 and M2 behave identically.

So approving both is **no worse than approving one**.

But why approve only one?

Suppose you approve only M1.

Then, if the other player approves only M2 → then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 → tie → random → either can win → then if a mediator is chosen, delegation can happen → so **delegation is still possible**.

Same if both approve M1 → M1 wins → delegation possible.

If you approve both, and the other approves only one → you still have possible delegation.

Even if you approve both, and the other approves both → then both have 2 approvals → tie → one chosen at random → still delegation possible.

So **no downside to approving both** — you **don’t reduce the chance of delegation**.

In fact, **approving both guarantees that no matter what the other player does**, the mediator will be available.

- If you approve both, even if the other player approves **no one**, then both mediators are unapproved → **no mediator** → no delegation → you get 3.

But if the other player approves **at least one**, and you approve both, then the number of approvals for each is at least 1 → so at least one mediator has the maximum number of approvals → so one is chosen → delegation possible.

So the only way delegation fails is if:
- You approve none, **or**
- You approve some, but the other approves none

So **to maximize your chance of delegation**, you want to minimize the risk of no mediator being available.

Approving both mediators **increases the chance** that, even if the other player approves only one, that one is approved by you → the chosen mediator is the one with max approvals.

But strategically,

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in response "Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediators)\n\nWe are Player 2 in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):\n\n|         | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| **A0 (P2)** | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |\n| **A1 (P2)** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |\n\nSo, in the base game, each player wants to coordinate on (A0, A0) for mutual benefit (5 each), but if only one person plays A0 and the other A1, the one playing A1 gets 3 while the one playing A0 gets 0.\n\nHowever, playing A1 against A0 gives you 3, and playing A1 against A1 gives you 3 — so A1 is never worse than A0 against A1, and A1 is better than A0 against A0? Wait — no.\n\nWait: You are Player 2.\n\nLet’s reorganize the payoffs from **Player 2's perspective** (you):\n\n- If you play A0:\n  - P1 plays A0 → you get 5\n  - P1 plays A1 → you get 0\n\n- If you play A1:\n  - P1 plays A0 → you get 3\n  - P1 plays A1 → you get 3\n\nSo from your perspective:\n- A0 gives you 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1\n- A1 gives you 3 regardless of what P1 does\n\nSo playing A1 is **never worse** than A0 — in fact, it guarantees 3, while A0 can give you 0.\n\nSo A1 is **weakly dominant** for you.\n\nIn fact, the Nash equilibria of the base game:\n- (A1, A1): both get 3 → no incentive to deviate\n- (A0, A0): both get 5 → but if you think P1 will play A0, you get 5 vs 3 if you switch to A1 → so (A0,A0) is unstable\n\nActually, let’s compute best responses.\n\nFor you (Player 2):\n- If P1 plays A0 → you best respond with A0 (5 > 3)\n- If P1 plays A1 → you best respond with A1 (3 = 3, so indifferent, but A1 is safe)\n\nSo your best response:\n- To A0: A0\n- To A1: A1 (indifferent, but A1 doesn't risk 0)\n\nBut if you assume P1 is rational, then P1 will not want to play A0 if you play A1 (since P1 gets 0), so P1 wants to play A1 if you play A1.\n\nWait — P1’s payoffs (same matrix):\n\n- P1 plays A0:\n  - You (P2) play A0 → P1 gets 5\n  - You play A1 → P1 gets 0 → bad\n- P1 plays A1:\n  - You play A0 → P1 gets 3\n  - You play A1 → P1 gets 3 → always 3\n\nSo for P1, playing A1 is also weakly dominant:\n- If you play A0 → P1 gets 0 if plays A0, 3 if plays A1 → so better to play A1\n- If you play A1 → P1 gets 3 either way\n\nSo both players have A1 as weakly dominant strategy.\n\nTherefore, the only **Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), where both get 3.\n\nSo in the base game, **rational players will end up at (A1, A1)** → you get 3.\n\nBut there is a **Pareto-dominant outcome**: (A0, A0), where you both get 5. But neither player has incentive to unilaterally play A0, since they risk getting 0.\n\nSo the outcome is inefficient: both get 3 when they could get 5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Mediator system\n\nNow each player can **delegate** their move to a mediator.\n\nYou get to **approve** mediators, and the mediator with **most approvals** wins (chosen uniformly at random if tie).\n\nThe proposed mediators:\n- M1: Proposed by Player 1\n- M2: Proposed by Player 2\n\n**Both mediators have identical behavior**:\n> If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1  \n> If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0\n\nSo both mediators behave the **same way**.\n\nWe are to decide: Which mediators do we approve?\n\nYou are Player 2.\n\nWe need to decide whether to approve M1 or M2, or both, or neither.\n\nBut since both mediators have **identical behavior**, they are **strategically equivalent**.\n\nSo, if we approve both, then both M1 and M2 will have the same number of approvals (assuming the other player approves one or both).\n\nBut **the final mediator is chosen uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.\n\nSo if you approve both, and the other player approves one, then you both have 1 approval → so both are tied for max → pick one at random → you have 50% chance of getting M1, 50% M2 — but since both are identical, it doesn't matter.\n\nIf you approve one (say M1), and the other player approves the same, they also have 1 ap, so tie → random choice.\n\nIf you approve both, and the other approves both, then both have 2 approvals → still random → but since both are identical, outcome is same.\n\nIf you approve both, but the other approves only one (say M1), then M1 has 2 approvals (you + P1), M2 has 1 → M1 wins.\n\nBut since both mediators play the same, **the outcome doesn’t depend on which mediator wins**.\n\nSo the only thing that matters is **who ends up being the mediator**, and since both behave identically, it doesn't matter.\n\nTherefore, the **behavior of the system depends only on the total number of delegations**, not on which mediator is picked.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet D be the number of players who delegate to the mediator: 0, 1, or 2.\n\n- If 0 delegate → both play independently → go back to base game → equilibrium at (A1, A1) → you get 3\n- If 1 delegates → the mediator plays A1 → so the delegating player's action is A1, the non-delegating player chooses their own action\n- If 2 delegate → the mediator plays A0 → so both players play A0 → you get 5\n\nSo the outcome depends on delegation.\n\nNow, the **mediator only acts when someone delegates**, and its behavior depends on how many delegates.\n\nBut the key: both mediators behave the same.\n\nSo you should always **approve mediators that have the same behavior**, unless there's a strategic reason not to.\n\nIn fact, if it doesn’t matter which mediator is used (they are identical), and you want to **maximize your chance of getting a good outcome**, then you want to:\n- Ensure the mediator **can be chosen** if desired\n- Especially since you can’t control the other player’s choice\n\nNow, **important**: you are choosing which mediators to approve, and the **winning mediator is the one with the most approvals** (random if tie).\n\nSo if you **don’t approve any**, then the mediator is not available → no delegation possible → you are forced to act independently → outcome is (A1, A1) → 3 points.\n\nBut if you **approve at least one**, and the other player also approves at least one, then it's possible for delegation to occur.\n\nLet’s consider possible outcomes.\n\nBut here's the key insight:\n\n> You want to **increase the chance that both players delegate** → because if both delegate, **mediator plays A0** → both get 5 → better for you.\n\n> But if only one delegates, mediator plays A1 → so one player plays A1 → the other plays independently.\n\nNow, **what will the non-delegating player do?**\n\nThey are playing independently, and for them, A1 is weakly dominant, so they will play A1.\n\nSo:\n- If only **one player delegates**: the delegate plays A1 (per mediator rules), the non-delegate plays A1 (rationally) → both play A1 → you get 3.\n\n- If **both delegate**: both play A0 → you get 5.\n\n- If **neither delegates**: both play independently → both play A1 (since A1 weakly dominant) → you get 3.\n\nSo the **only way to get 5 points** is if **both players delegate**.\n\nThus, your point outcome:\n- 5 if both delegate\n- 3 if 0 or 1 delegate\n\nSo to maximize your expected payoff, you want to **maximize the probability that both delegate**.\n\nBut delegation only happens if the mediator is available — i.e., if **at least one player approves** the winning mediator.\n\nSo if you don’t approve any mediator, then no mediator is available → no delegation → both act independently → both play A1 → you get 3.\n\nSo never choosing delegation leads to 3.\n\nBut if you approve a mediator, you open the possibility of delegation.\n\nNow, the other player is also deciding whom to approve.\n\nLet’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own points.\n\nWe are Player 2.\n\nLet’s think about incentives.\n\nSuppose **you approve both mediators**.\n\nThen:\n- The other player also wants to get 5 points → so they want *both* to delegate → so they will try to ensure that the mediator is available and that they can coordinate on delegation.\n\nBut there’s a catch: if only one of the mediators is approved, then even if both approve it, then it can win.\n\nBut if both mediators are approved by both players, then both have 2 approvals → tie → pick uniformly at random → mediator selected → then both delegate → A0 → you get 5.\n\nBut suppose you approve only one mediator (say M1), and the other player approves only M1 → then M1 wins → both delegate → A0 → you get 5.\n\nSame if you approve only M1 and they approve M2 → then M1 and M2 each have 1 approval → tie → random selection → say M1 wins → both delegate → A0.\n\nSo in all cases, **if both players approve at least one mediator (possibly different ones), then it’s possible for a mediator to be selected** — and **if both people delegate**, then both get A0 → 5.\n\nBut here’s the catch: do both players actually want to delegate?\n\nLet’s think about **individual incentives to delegate**.\n\nSuppose you approve a mediator (say M1), and assume the mediator will be chosen (either because only one is approved, or tied).\n\nNow, **will you delegate**?\n\nLet’s analyze:\n\nYou are deciding whether to delegate or not.\n\nIf you delegate:\n- You get whatever the mediator plays, depending on how many delegate.\n\nBut you alone decide to delegate — the other player may not.\n\nSo you need to consider the other player’s choice.\n\nBut we can think about **dominance**.\n\nLet’s suppose you **do not delegate**.\n\nThen:\n- The mediator chooses what you do.\n- But no, if you don’t delegate, you choose your own action.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\nCase 1: You **don’t delegate**, and the other player **does delegate** → follows the mediator.\n\nThen, since only one player delegates → mediator plays A1 → the delegator plays A1 → you (Player 2) play independently.\n\nYou will play A1 (dominant strategy), so resulting actions: A1 (you), A1 (other) → you get 3.\n\nCase 2: You **don’t delegate**, and the other player **doesn’t delegate** → both play independently → A1 vs A1 → you get 3.\n\nCase 3: You **do delegate**, and the other player **doesn’t delegate** → one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A1 → you get 3.\n\nCase 4: You **do delegate**, and the other player **does delegate** → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0 → other plays A0 → you get 5.\n\nSo your payoff depends on whether **both** delegate.\n\nBut **you can only control your own delegation**, not the other player’s.\n\nSo if you don’t delegate, you get 3 regardless.\n\nIf you **do delegate**, you get 3 unless the other player also delegates → in which case you get 5.\n\nSo **you get a higher payoff if both delegate** → but you can't control the other player.\n\nSo you might be afraid of delegating: if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get A1 (3) — same as not delegating.\n\nIf you delegate and the other does, you get 5 → better.\n\nBut if you don’t delegate, you never get more than 3.\n\nSo **you have a strategic incentive to delegate — but only if you expect the other to delegate as well**.\n\nBut there’s a coordination issue.\n\nHowever, here’s a key: you are **choosing which mediator to approve** — and you can **influence the probability** that the mediator is available.\n\nBut you don’t control the other player.\n\nBut the **mediator is chosen from those approved** — so to **maximize the chance of delegation**, you want the mediator to be **available**, because if no mediator is available, delegation can’t happen.\n\nSo if you **do not approve any mediator**, then no mediation is possible → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 3.\n\nIf you **approve at least one mediator**, then as long as the other player also approves at least one, **there will be a mediator chosen**, so delegation is possible.\n\nBut can you **force** both players to delegate?\n\nNo — but you can **increase the chance** that delegation occurs.\n\nHowever, **each player must decide whether to delegate**, and they only benefit if both delegate.\n\nSo unless there’s a way to **coordinate** on delegation, it may not happen.\n\nBut here’s the insight: **if both players approve at least one mediator, then a mediator is available → so delegation is possible.**\n\nThen, if **both players expect the other to delegate**, they might both delegate and get 5.\n\nBut is delegation a best response?\n\nYes — if you think the other player will delegate, then:\n- If you delegate → you get 5\n- If you don’t → you get 3 (since other player plays A1 via delegation or independently?)\n\nWait — if the other player delegates, they play A1 if only one delegates.\n\nBut if both delegate, the mediator plays A0.\n\nSo suppose you believe the other player will delegate.\n\nThen:\n- If you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 5\n- If you don’t delegate → only one delegates (the other player) → mediator plays A1 → other player plays A1 → you play independently → you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3\n\nSo **you strictly prefer to delegate** if you expect the other to delegate.\n\nSimilarly, the other player has the same incentive.\n\nSo if **both believe the other will delegate**, then both want to delegate → (delegation, delegation) is a Nash equilibrium in the delegation stage.\n\nBut there’s also a **pure strategy equilibrium** where **neither delegates**:\n- If you don’t delegate, and the other doesn’t → you get 3\n- If you deviate and delegate, you risk getting 3 (if other doesn't delegate) instead of 3 → no benefit\n\nBut if others don’t delegate, then:\n- If you unilaterally delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → other plays A1 → you get 3\n- Same as not delegating → so indifferent\n\nBut if the other player doesn’t delegate, and you delegate → you get 3 (same as if you didn’t).\n\nSo you are indifferent.\n\nBut if you **can** coordinate on both delegating, you both get 5 → better than 3.\n\nSo the **only way to get more than 3** is to **both delegate**.\n\nBut delegation is only possible if **a mediator is available**.\n\nSo for delegation to be possible, at least one mediator must be approved by **some player**.\n\nThe **only way delegation can happen** is if **at least one mediator is approved by at least one player**.\n\nBut even then, delegation **depends on both players actually choosing to delegate**.\n\nSo now, the best strategy for you is:\n\n- Approve **at least one mediator**, so that delegation is possible → then if the other player also approves, and both players can coordinate on delegation, you both get 5.\n\n- If you **don’t approve any**, then no mediator → no delegation → both play A1 → you get 3.\n\nSince 5 > 3, you **prefer** the possibility of 5.\n\nSo you **must** approve **at least one**.\n\nNow, which ones?\n\nM1 and M2 behave identically.\n\nSo approving both is **no worse than approving one**.\n\nBut why approve only one?\n\nSuppose you approve only M1.\n\nThen, if the other player approves only M2 → then M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 1 → tie → random → either can win → then if a mediator is chosen, delegation can happen → so **delegation is still possible**.\n\nSame if both approve M1 → M1 wins → delegation possible.\n\nIf you approve both, and the other approves only one → you still have possible delegation.\n\nEven if you approve both, and the other approves both → then both have 2 approvals → tie → one chosen at random → still delegation possible.\n\nSo **no downside to approving both** — you **don’t reduce the chance of delegation**.\n\nIn fact, **approving both guarantees that no matter what the other player does**, the mediator will be

response:
Let's carefully analyze the problem step by step, focusing on the decision of which mediators to approve.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game
You are Player 2 in a 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 × Player 2):

|         | A0 (P1) | A1 (P1) |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P2)** | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **A1 (P2)** | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

From **your perspective (Player 2)**:
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0 and P1 plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A0 → you get 3
- If you play A1 and P1 plays A1 → you get 3

So:
- A0 gives you 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if P1 plays A1
- A1 gives you 3 **regardless** of P1’s action

Thus, **A1 is weakly dominant** for you: it never gives you less than A0, and it guarantees 3 (while A0 risks 0).

Similarly, P1 also has A1 as weakly dominant. So the only Nash equilibrium is **(A1, A1)** → both get 3.

But the outcome (A0, A0) gives both 5 → **Pareto superior**. However, neither player can unilaterally commit to A0 without risking 0.

So without delegation, you get 3.

---

### Step 2: Understand the mediator system

You can **approve** mediators. After approval voting, the mediator with **most approvals** wins (random if tied). If no mediator is approved by anyone, **no delegation is possible**.

The winning mediator will play:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

**Both M1 and M2 are proposed with identical behavior** — so they are **strategically identical**.

Their behavior depends **only on the number of delegates**, not on which mediator is chosen.

Therefore:
- If both players delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 5
- If only one delegates → mediator plays A1 → the delegate plays A1, the non-delegate plays independently (and will play A1), so both end up playing A1 → you get 3
- If no one delegates → both play independently → both play A1 → you get 3

Thus, your **only way to get 5 points is if both players delegate**.

But delegation requires:
1. A mediator is **available** (i.e., approved by at least one player and selected)
2. Both players **choose to delegate**

---

### Step 3: Strategic incentives to approve and delegate

Your goal: **Maximize your expected points**.

#### If you approve **no mediator**:
- No mediator can be selected
- Delegation is impossible
- Both play independently → (A1, A1) → you get **3**

This is **not optimal** — you have a chance to get 5.

#### If you approve **at least one mediator**:
- Then, if the other player approves at least one, a mediator is available
- Delegation becomes possible
- You can **coordinate** on both delegating, which gives you 5

Now, **do you want to delegate?**

Suppose you expect the other player to delegate:
- If you delegate → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 (rational) → you get 3

So you **strictly prefer to delegate** if you expect the other to delegate.

Similarly, the other player has the same incentive.

So **if both players approve at least one mediator**, and they coordinate on delegation, both delegate → you get 5.

This is **better than 3**, so coordination is a stable possibility.

But the **only way to make delegation possible** is if **at least one mediator is approved by at least one player**.

Now, **your choice of which mediators to approve affects availability**.

- If you approve **only M1**, and the other player approves only M2, then both have 1 approval → tie → one is chosen at random → **mediator is available** → delegation possible
- If you approve **only M1**, and the other approves nothing → M1 has 1 approval, M2 has 0 → M1 wins → delegation possible
- If you approve **both**, even if the other approves only M1 → M1 has 2 approval, M2 has 1 → M1 wins → available
- If you approve **both**, and the other approves nothing → both mediators have 0 approvals → **no mediator wins** → no delegation

So **approving both mediators increases the risk that no mediator is selected if the other player approves nothing**, but only if **you approve both and the other approves none**.

But since the other player is rational, they also want to get 5 — so they will **want to approve at least one** to enable delegation.

So if both players are rational and cooperative, they will both approve **at least one**.

Therefore, **approving both mediators does not reduce the chance of delegation** — the only scenario where delegation fails is if **one player approves none**.

But since both want delegation to be possible, **both have an incentive to approve at least one**.

Moreover, **approving both mediators doesn't hurt you** — it only increases the chance that a mediator is available **if the other player approves one**.

- Approving one: you are in a 50-50 with the other player — but if they approve a different one, you still get coverage.
- Approving both: you guarantee that **any** mediator the other player approves is covered.

Therefore, approving both **maximizes the availability** of a mediator **regardless of the other player's choices**, **as long as they approve at least one**.

Since both players want the 5-point outcome, they will try to enable it.

Thus, **approving both M1 and M2 is the safe, optimal choice**.

It ensures:
- Delegation is possible even if the other player approves only one
- The mediator is selected (random if tie, but since behavior is identical, it doesn’t matter)
- You are not reducing any chance of coordination

Also, since M1 and M2 have **identical behavior**, **there is no downside to approving both**.

---

### Final Decision

You should **approve both mediators**, because:
- They behave identically → no strategic difference
- Approving both maximizes the probability that a mediator is available
- This increases the chance that both delegate → leading to the 5-point outcome
- There is **no downside** to approving both

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:

response:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Understanding Payoffs
We must first understand the payoffs for each action and how delegating to the mediator influences our outcomes.

#### Independent Choices
- **Both choose A0**: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
- **You choose A0, other chooses A1**: you get 0 points, the other gets 3 points.
- **You choose A1, other chooses A0**: you get 3 points, the other gets 0 points.
- **Both choose A1**: you get 3 points, the other gets 3 points.

#### Delegation Effects
- **You delegate, the other does not**: Mediator will play A1; your payoff will be decided by the other player's choice.
- **Both delegate**: Mediator will play A0 for both, resulting in mutual payoff of 5 points each.

### Step 2: Analyzing Mediator Advantage
From the payoffs, we see that:
- If **both** players delegate, it's optimal since both get 5 points.
- If only one player delegates, the delegating player gets 3 points, depending on the other player's choice.

### Step 3: Strategic Decision
To maximize our points, we need to consider the probability the other player might also delegate:

1. **High probability the other player will also delegate**:
   - Choose to delegate (A2) to ensure the mediator plays A0 for both (maximum mutual payout 5 points).
   
2. **Moderate to low probability the other player will delegate**:
   - Create a mixed strategy that balances between independent actions and delegating to capture at least 3 points.

### Step 4: Formulating the Mixed Strategy
Based on the analysis, let's assign probabilities:
- **Delegate to Mediator (A2)**: High probability that the other player also sees the benefit of both getting 5 points.
  
Given that full delegation (A2) seems optimal but we allow a slight chance for independent actions for mixed strategy balance:

- **A0**: A defensive action if we anticipate the other will choose A1.
- **A1**: To cover the aggressive move if the other does not delegate.

Assume:
- 70% chance of other player also recognizing mutual benefit and delegating.
- 15% each for independent actions, ensuring some probability of capturing 3 points if the other doesn’t delegate.

### Final Strategy
```json
{"A0": 15, "A1": 15, "A2": 70}
```

This mixed strategy optimally balances the likelihood of maximizing scores through delegation while providing some flexibility to account for non-delegation scenarios.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2’s is symmetric in structure):

|                | Player 2: A0 | Player 2: A1 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Player 1: A0** | 5, 5         | 0, 3         |
| **Player 1: A1** | 3, 0         | 3, 3         |

This is a coordination game with a twist:
- If both play A0, great payoff (5,5).
- If you play A0 and they play A1, you get nothing (0).
- If you play A1 and they play A0, you get 3 (better than 0, but worse than 5).
- If both play A1, you both get 3.

So:
- A0 is best if the other plays A0.
- A1 is safe: you get 3 regardless of what the other does (if they also play A1) or 3 if they play A0.

But note: If you play A1, you get **3 no matter what** — because:
- (A1, A0): 3
- (A1, A1): 3

So **A1 is a dominant strategy** in the base game.

Wait — let’s double-check:

- If you play A0:
  - vs A0: 5
  - vs A1: 0 → average depends on your belief
- If you play A1:
  - vs A0: 3
  - vs A1: 3 → always 3

So A1 is **weakly dominant** — for any strategy of the opponent, A1 gives at least as much as A0, and strictly more in some cases. In fact, **it gives 3 vs 0 if the other plays A1**, so it’s a clear improvement.

Therefore, in the base game, **rational players should choose A1**, leading to (A1, A1) and 3 points each.

But wait — is that the only Nash equilibrium?

Let’s check:
- (A0, A0): is this a NE? If you deviate to A1 while the other plays A0, you get 3 > 0 → so player 1 wants to deviate → not NE.
- (A0, A1): Player 1 gets 0, if they switch to A1, get 3 → so wants to deviate → not NE.
- (A1, A0): Player 2 gets 0, if they switch to A1, get 3 → deviates → not NE.
- (A1, A1): both get 3. If either deviates to A0, gets 0 < 3 → so no incentive to deviate → **this is a Nash equilibrium**.

So the **only Nash equilibrium** is (A1, A1), leading to 3 points each.

But is there a **risk of coordination failure**? Yes. If both *want* to play A0 (5 > 3), but no way to coordinate, and A1 is safe, they may end up playing A1 anyway.

But here’s the key: **we are now in a setting where we can delegate to mediators.**

---

### **Step 2: Delegation and Approval Voting**

You and the other player will **simultaneously approve** of mediators.

Then, the **mediator with the most approvals** is selected uniformly at random (if tied, randomly among the max-approved ones).

Then, **each player decides whether to delegate to the selected mediator or act independently.**

But you are only asked to **approve** mediators at this stage. So your choice now is: **which mediators do you approve?**

There are **two** mediators proposed:

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If 1 player delegates to it → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0

So **always plays A0**, regardless of how many people delegate.

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- If 1 player delegates to it → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate to it → plays A0

So:
- If it's chosen and only one player delegates → it plays A1
- If both players delegate → it plays A0

---

### **Step 3: Analyze What You Want — Maximize Your Own Points**

You are **Player 1**.

You want to **maximize your expected points**.

You do not know whether the other player will delegate or not, nor whether they will approve which mediators.

But: you can **approve or disapprove** of each mediator.

The **winning mediator** will be **uniform at random from those with maximum approvals**.

Then, **after** the mediator is selected, each player **decides** whether to delegate (play via mediator) or act independently.

You control your own **approval** choices now, but can't control their actions later. But you can influence the outcome via approval.

---

### **Step 4: Key Strategy Insights**

Let’s think about what each mediator does:

- **M1 (Player 1’s proposed mediator)**:
  - Always plays A0.
  - So if you delegate to it, you will play A0.
  - If you don’t delegate, you can choose your own action.

- **M2 (Player 2’s proposed mediator)**:
  - Plays A1 if only one person delegates.
  - Plays A0 if both delegate.

So if:
- You delegate and the other doesn’t → mediator plays A1 → you get A1.
- You both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you both play A0.

But: if you don’t delegate, you can play A0 or A1 yourself.

But remember: in the base game, **A1 is dominant**, so unless you can coordinate on A0, you’ll end up at 3 (if both play A1).

But **A0 gives you 5 only if both play A0**.

So **coordination on A0** gives you a better payoff.

But if you're the only one trying to play A0, you get 0.

Hence, **your strategy depends on whether you think you can coordinate on A0**.

Now, think about your **approval choices**.

---

### **Step 5: Consider Outcomes Based on Approval Decisions**

You can **approve or disapprove** M1 and M2.

But the **winning mediator** is the one with the most approvals (randomly chosen if tied).

Let’s consider possible approval scenarios.

But first, think: **what would benefit you?**

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**, so you want to possibly get 5, or at least avoid losing.

But remember: your **final action** depends on:
1. Which mediator is selected (based on approvals).
2. Whether you delegate (your choice after the mediator is known).

You will **choose optimally after seeing the mediator**.

So your **choice depends on the mediator**.

---

### **Step 6: What do you do after the mediator is known?**

You will act rationally **after** knowing the mediator.

So suppose M1 is the chosen mediator.

- M1 **always plays A0**, regardless of delegation.
- So if you delegate, you play A0.
- If you don’t delegate, you can choose A0 or A1.

But since M1 plays A0 no matter what, and you get:
- **If you play A0**: depends on other player's action.
- **If you play A1**: you get 3 if other plays A0, 0 if other plays A1.

But if M1 is chosen, then **you can choose to delegate or not**.

But the mediator is the one who plays for you — and it plays A0 always.

So:
- If you delegate → you play A0
- If you don’t delegate → you can choose your own action.

So **what should you do if M1 is chosen?**

You can choose to **not delegate** and play A1 (since A1 is dominant: always 3).

Or you can delegate and play A0.

But if you play A0, your payoff depends on the other player:
- If they play A0 → 5
- If they play A1 → 0

But if you play A1, you get 3 regardless (safe).

So unless you're **very confident** the other will play A0, playing A1 is better.

But you don’t know.

So your optimal choice **depends on beliefs**.

But since you’re trying to maximize expected payoff, and you know you can get 3 for sure by playing A1, and A0 gives **expected payoff of 5×p + 0×(1−p)**, which is 5p.

Only if p > 0.6 (probability the other plays A0), is A0 better than 3.

But **without coordination**, you can’t be sure.

So **unless you have confidence in coordination**, A1 is better.

But here’s a twist: **the mediator is playing A0**, but it's not affecting the other player's action unless the other player also delegates.

So the other player’s action is **independent** of the mediator unless they delegate.

So the mediator only affects **your own action**, not theirs.

So your best response **when M1 is selected** is to **not delegate** and play A1 (to get 3 guaranteed), unless you believe the other player will play A0 with high probability.

But you have **no control** over their behavior.

So in the absence of coordination, **best to play A1 and get 3**.

Therefore:
- If M1 is selected, you should **not delegate**, and play A1 → you get 3.

So why would you want M1 to be selected?

Maybe you don’t.

Now consider **M2**.

M2 plays:
- A1 if **only one** person delegates
- A0 if **both** people delegate

So if M2 is selected:
- You can choose to delegate or not.
- The other player can choose to delegate or not.

But **both decide after** the mediator is picked.

So after M2 is picked, you can plan.

Suppose **only one player delegates** → M2 plays A1.

Suppose **both delegate** → M2 plays A0.

So if you **do not delegate**, you play A0 or A1 yourself.

Now, what should you do **if M2 is selected**?

Let’s consider your options.

Case 1: You **delegate** to M2.

Then you play:
- A1 if the other **does not** delegate.
- A0 if the other **does** delegate.

Case 2: You **do not delegate**.

Then your action is independent.

But you can choose A0 or A1 to maximize your payoff depending on your belief about the other player.

But again, since A1 is dominant, you'd only play A0 if you’re confident the other will play A0.

So let’s suppose you **do not delegate** → you can choose A1 (safe, 3) or A0 (risky, could get 0 or 5).

So unless you’re sure, you’d play A1.

Now compare:

**Scenario: M2 is selected.**

You consider:

- If you delegate:
  - If other does not delegate → you get A1 → if other plays A0 → you get 3, if other plays A1 → you get 0.
  - If other **does** delegate → you play A0 → if other plays A0 → you get 5, if other plays A1 → you get 0.

But wait — the other player also chooses their action.

So you have to think about **what the other player will do**.

But crucially: **you both decide your delegation after the mediator is known.**

So you can condition your strategy on the mediator.

But the other player does the same.

So it becomes a **game**.

But we are only deciding **approval now**.

We need to make **an optimal approval choice**.

But we can anticipate the outcome.

Let’s go back.

---

### **Step 7: Your Goal: Maximize Expected Payoff**

You want to maximize your **expected points** over the entire process.

So let’s look at **which mediators are good for you**.

#### **M1: always plays A0**

You can:
- Delegate → play A0
- Or not delegate → play A1 (safe)

So you should **not delegate** → play A1 → get 3.

So M1 offers you **no benefit**.

In fact, if M1 is selected, you still get 3 (by playing A1), same as in the base game.

So M1 **doesn’t improve** your payoff.

But it might **hurt** if the other player delegates and plays A0, but that doesn't help you directly unless you also play A0.

But you won’t delegate to M1.

So M1 is **useless** for you — you wouldn’t use it anyway.

So you get **no benefit from M1**.

But you **could disapprove** it.

Is there a reason to approve M1?

Only if making M1 more likely to be selected **makes you better off**.

But if M1 is selected, you still play A1 → get 3.

Same as if no mediator is used, or M2 is selected.

So **M1 has no strategic value**.

So **no benefit to approving M1**.

Thus, **do not approve M1** → `false`

#### **M2: conditional on delegation count**

M2 is **more interesting**.

If M2 is selected, you have two choices:
- Delegate → your action depends on **how many delegate**
  - If you're the only one delegate → you play A1
  - If both delegate → you play A0
- Not delegate → you can play A1 (safe)

Now, **what if you both delegate?**

Then M2 plays A0 for both → so both play A0 → you get 5.

That’s great.

But if **only one** delegates → that person plays A1 (from M2), and the non-delegating one can play A1 or A0.

So if **only you delegate**, you play A1, and the other plays A1 → you get 3, they get 3.

Or if other plays A0, you get 0.

But if the other plays A1, you get 0, they get 3.

So if only you delegate, you play A1 → you get 0 if other plays A1.

But they might also play A1.

So **risk**.

But here’s the key:

**Suppose you can coordinate with the other player to both delegate to M2**.

Then:
- M2 sees 2 delegations → plays A0
- Both play A0
- You both get 5

That’s **better than 3**.

So **if you can both delegate**, you get 5.

But **can you coordinate**?

You need to **approve M2** to make it possible.

But you also need the other player to approve M2, and to **be willing to delegate**.

So your goal is to **make it likely that both of you delegate to M2 and both get 5**.

But how?

Let’s suppose you **approve M2**.

The other player may or may not.

But let’s suppose they also approve M2.

Then M2 is selected (assuming no tie with M1, but if you approved M1, maybe not).

Suppose you **approve M2 and disapprove M1**.

Then only M2 has 1 approval (yours), so only M2 gets approval → M2 is selected.

Then both players know M2 is selected.

Now, both players decide: delegate or not.

Now, if **both delegate**, then M2 plays A0 → you both get 5.

If one delegates and the other doesn’t:
- The delegate plays A1
- The non-delegate can play A0 or A1

But if the non-delegate plays A0, and the delegate plays A1 → you get 0.

If non-delegate plays A1 → both play A1 → 3.

So if only one delegates → that player gets:
- 0 if other plays A0
- 3 if other plays A1

So unless you're sure the other will play A1, you get 3 or less.

But you can choose to play A1 yourself.

But the delegate gets 3 only if the other plays A1, 0 otherwise.

So **it’s risky** to be the only delegate.

But **if both delegate**, you both get 5 — **much better**.

So **both players would prefer to coordinate on both delegating**, leading to A0, 5.

And 5 > 3, so it’s **strictly better**.

So if both are rational, and can observe that M2 is selected, they can **coordinate on both delegating**, and get 5.

This is a **mutual benefit**.

So if M2 is selected and both players approve M2, then they will **both delegate**, get 5.

Perfect.

But if you **disapprove M2**, and only approve M1, then M1 is selected.

M1 plays A0 always.

Then you play A1 (as rational player), get 3.

Same for other player.

So you get 3.

But if M2 is selected and both delegate, you get 5 → better.

So **you want M2 to be selected**, and **to be able to coordinate**.

But **can M2 be selected**?

Only if it gets at least as many approvals as other mediators.

You can **approve M2** to make it more likely.

But if you disapprove M2, then M2 gets 0 approvals.

M1 gets your approval if you approve it.

So if you approve M1 and disapprove M2, then:
- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 0 approvals
→ M1 is selected.

Then you play A1 → get 3.

Worse than 5.

So if you **disapprove M2**, and **approve M1**, you get 3.

But if you **approve M2**, and the other player **also approves M2**, then M2 is selected (assuming M1 is not approved by you or others), so M2 is selected, then you can both delegate → get 5.

So **you want M2 to be selected**.

But can you **force** it? No.

But if you **approve M2**, you increase the chance it gets selected.

Also, if you **disapprove M1**, you reduce chance of M1 being selected.

Suppose you **approve M2**, **disapprove M1**.

Then:
- M1: 0 (if others don’t approve)
- M2: 1 (yours)

So M2 wins (only one approved).

Then M2 is selected.

Then, **both players** can see M2 is selected.

Now, both can **choose to delegate**.

If both delegate → both play A0 → get 5.

If only one delegates → that one gets either 0 or 3, worse than 5.

So **both players have incentive to delegate**, and will coordinate on doing so.

Thus, you get 5.

If the other player **does not approve M2**, then M2 gets only 1 (yours), M1 gets 0 (if you disapprove) → M2 is selected.

Same result.

So as long as you **approve M2 and disapprove M1**, you ensure **M2 is selected**, because M2 has 1 approval, M1 has 0 (if you disapprove), so M2 wins.

Then, you can coordinate on both delegating → both play A0 → you get 5.

If you **approve M1**, but not M2: M1 selected → you get 3.

If you **approve both**, then both have 1 approval → tie → **M2 wins with probability 0.5**.

Then:
- With prob 0.5, M2 is selected → then both delegate → you get 5
- With prob 0.5, M1 is selected → you get 3 (by playing A1)

So your expected payoff: (0.5)(5) + (0.5)(3) = 2.5 + 1.5 = 4

But if you **approve only M2**, disapprove M1:
- M2 selected for sure → you get 5

Better than 4.

So **better to approve only M2**.

Thus, **you should approve M2 and disapprove M1**.

Is there a case where approving M1 helps?

Suppose the other player **approves M1**.

Then if you **approve M1**, M1 gets 2 approvals, M2 gets 1 (if you don’t approve) → M1 wins.

But if you approve M2 but not M1, M2 wins.

But if you approve M1, and the other approves M1, M1 wins → you get 3.

But you could have gotten 5 if M2 wins.

So **by approving M1**, you **risk losing the chance to get 5**.

So **never beneficial to approve M1**, because:
- It doesn’t help you
- But it might cause M1 to win instead of M2
- M2 gives you chance at 5, M1 only gives 3
- So M1 is harmful

Only way M1 helps is if you **can’t get M2 selected**, but in this case you can **ensure M2 is selected** by **approving M2 and disapproving M1**.

So doing so **maximizes your chance to get 5**.

Hence, **approve M2**, **disapprove M1**.

Even if the other player approves M1, if you disapprove M1, then:
- M1: 1 (the other's approval)
- M2: 1 (yours) → tie → so **M2 is selected with 50% chance** (random)

Then:
- With 50%: M2 → both delegate → you get 5
- With 50%: M1 → you get 3

So expected payoff: 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4

But if you **approve both**, then both have 2 approvals → tie → M2 wins with 50% → same expected payoff: 4

But if you **approve only M2**, disapprove M1:
- M2: 1 (yours), M1: 0 → M2 wins for sure → you get 5

**This is better**.

So **always better to approve only M2**.

If the other player approves M1, you can **still ensure M2 wins** by **not approving M1**.

So **approve only M2**.

What if you approve M1 but not M2?
Then M1 wins (assuming others don’t approve M2), you get 3 → worst.

So **no reason to approve M1**.

Thus:

- **Approve M2**: yes → to enable the coordination path to 5 points
- **Approve M1**: no → it risks blocking M2, and gives no benefit

Looking at this step-by-step:

## Step 1: Understand the Game Structure

As Player 2, my payoffs are:
- Both play A0: I get 5
- I play A0, other plays A1: I get 0  
- I play A1, other plays A0: I get 3
- Both play A1: I get 3

The game has two Nash equilibria: (A0, A0) giving 5 to each, and (A1, A1) giving 3 to each. The challenge is coordinating on the better outcome.

## Step 2: Analyze Mediator M1

M1 always plays A0 regardless of how many delegate.

**Scenarios:**
- Both delegate → (A0, A0) → both get 5 ✓
- Only I delegate → I'm locked into A0
  - If Player 1 plays A1: I get 0 (vulnerable!)
- Only Player 1 delegates → Player 1 plays A0
  - I could play A1 and get 3 while they get 0 (exploitation opportunity)

**Issue:** M1 creates exploitation risk. If I delegate alone, I'm vulnerable to getting 0.

## Step 3: Analyze Mediator M2  

M2 plays A1 if one player delegates, A0 if both delegate.

**Scenarios:**
- Both delegate → (A0, A0) → both get 5 ✓
- Only I delegate → I play A1
  - Player 1's best response is A1 → I get 3 (protected!)
- Only Player 1 delegates → Player 1 plays A1  
  - My best response is A1 → both get 3 (no exploitation)

**Advantage:** M2 has a built-in protection mechanism. If you delegate alone, you play A1 (getting 3), preventing exploitation where you'd get 0.

## Step 4: Compare Mediators

**M2 is superior because:**
1. **Same upside**: Both achieve (5, 5) when both delegate
2. **Better downside protection**: M2 protects solo delegators from exploitation (guaranteed 3 vs. risking 0)
3. **Stronger coordination incentive**: The protection makes delegation safer, increasing the likelihood of mutual delegation
4. **Strategic complementarity**: M2 creates a clear incentive structure where both players benefit from coordinating on delegation

**M1's problem:** It makes delegation risky without mutual trust, as solo delegators play A0 and risk getting 0 if exploited.

## Conclusion

M2 is the better mediator design for both players as it facilitates coordination on the efficient outcome while protecting against exploitation.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:
- Choose a probability distribution over the provided actions each round.
- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

Format requirement:
Return exactly one JSON object, for example:

To maximize points in this game, we first analyze the payoff matrix for Player 2 (your position):

*   **P2 chooses A0 or A2 (Delegate):** Your action results in A0.
    *   If P1 chooses A0 or A2: You get **5 points**, P1 gets 5 points.
    *   If P1 chooses A1: You get **0 points**, P1 gets 3 points.
*   **P2 chooses A1:**
    *   If P1 chooses A0 or A2: You get **3 points**, P1 gets 0 points.
    *   If P1 chooses A1: You get **3 points**, P1 gets 3 points.

P1's payoff matrix is symmetric. Both players have a choice between a high-payoff, high-risk option (A0 or A2) and a guaranteed-payoff, lower-risk option (A1).

### Strategy Analysis:
1.  **Nash Equilibria:** There are two pure-strategy Nash Equilibria: (A0/A2, A0/A2) which yields (5, 5), and (A1, A1) which yields (3, 3).
2.  **Risk Dominance:** To prefer A0/A2 over A1, you must believe the probability ($p$) of the other player choosing A0/A2 is such that $5p + 0(1-p) > 3$. Solving for $p$ gives $5p > 3$ or $p > 0.6$.
3.  **Coordination Mechanism:** Player 1 proposed the mediator and it was selected via approval voting. This strongly signals Player 1's intent to coordinate on the (A0, A0) outcome. By delegating to the mediator (A2) or choosing A0, Player 1 is signaling a commitment to the 5-point strategy.

Since Player 1 initiated the mediator setup, the probability $p$ that they will choose A0 or A2 is very likely higher than 0.6. Therefore, the optimal strategy to maximize points is to coordinate on action A0. Action A2 (Delegate) is functionally equivalent to A0 in this specific mediator setup, but choosing it reinforces the coordination signal.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let’s go step by step to analyze this decision-making game, including the mediation and approval voting system.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediation)**

Players choose actions A0 or A1 simultaneously with probabilities. Payoffs:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This is **not** a standard prisoner’s dilemma. Let’s analyze strategic incentives.

- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → you get 5 (best).
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 (worst).
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 3.
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → you get 3.

So:
- A0 is good only if the other plays A0.
- A1 gives you 3 regardless — safe, but not optimal if opponent cooperates.

Let’s find Nash equilibria.

Suppose both play A1 → both get 3. If you unilaterally switch to A0, and opponent still plays A1, you get 0 → worse. So A1 is best response to A1.

Suppose both play A0 → both get 5. If you switch to A1, you get 3 → worse. So A0 is best response to A0.

So **(A0, A0)** and **(A1, A1)** are both pure-strategy Nash equilibria.

Is there a mixed equilibrium?

Let’s suppose opponent plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1-p).

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p
- If you play A1: 3p + 3(1-p) = 3

Set equal: 5p = 3 → p = 0.6

So if opponent plays A0 with 60%, you are indifferent between A0 and A1.

Similarly, symmetrically, if you play A0 with 60%, the other is indifferent.

So there’s a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

But in this game, **(A0, A0)** gives the highest total payoff (10), while **(A1, A1)** gives only 6. So **(A0, A0) is Pareto optimal**, but unstable without coordination.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediation Mechanism**

- Before playing, both players participate in an **approval voting** to choose which mediator will be used.
- Each player can approve of one or more mediators.
- The **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- Then, you may **choose to delegate** your move or play independently.
- If you delegate, the mediator plays an action based on **how many players delegated to it**.

Note: You are **Player 1**, opponent is **Player 2**.

The two mediators:

---

#### **Mediator M1 ("Proposed by Player 1"):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So regardless of number of delegates, M1 always plays A0.

---

#### **Mediator M2 ("Proposed by Player 2"):**
- If 1 player delegates → plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So:
- If only one person delegates → it plays A1
- If both delegate → it plays A0

Note: This mediator’s behavior depends on how many delegates it has.

---

### **Step 3: What is Your Objective?**

Maximize your **total points** over the game.

But note: You must decide which mediators to **approve** **before** knowing whether you will delegate or not. And the mediation action (delegate or not) happens **after** the mediator is selected.

So your approval choices affect **which mediator is available** for the game, not which one you use. But crucially, the **winning mediator is chosen randomly from the most-approved ones**, so you want to control that selection.

You can only delegate to the **winning mediator** (i.e., the one selected after approval voting). You cannot use a mediator that wasn’t approved or that wasn’t selected.

Also: Since you are Player 1 and must approve mediators, and your opponent is Player 2, you do **not** know the opponent’s choices — only that they are trying to maximize their **own** points.

So we must model this as a **sequential** game:
1. You and opponent independently approve (or disapprove) mediators → this determines which mediator(s) are finalists.
2. Then, a winning mediator is chosen uniformly at random from the ones with max approvals.
3. Then, each player decides whether to **delegate** or not.
4. Then, final actions are determined based on delegation and mediator rules.

---

### **Step 4: Strategy Considerations**

You want **good outcomes** (especially (A0, A0)) and **your own payoff to be high**.

Let’s think about the **possible outcomes** under each mediator, based on how many players delegate.

---

#### **Mediator M1 (always plays A0)**

- If **you delegate to M1**, you play A0.
- If **opponent delegates to M1**, opponent plays A0.
- If **neither delegates**, both play independently (no mediation).

But again, the **winning mediator** is the one that emerges from approval voting.

So if only M1 is approved by both, it wins. If both are approved, and both get same approval count, one is picked randomly.

---

#### **Mediator M2 (plays A1 if 1 delegate, A0 if 2 delegates)**

- If **only one player** delegates: that player’s action is A1.
- If **both players** delegate: both actions become A0.
- If **neither** delegates: independent play.

So M2 can be used to coordinate both playing A0 **if both delegate**.

That is powerful.

For example:
- If **you delegate and opponent delegates**, both get A0 → you get 5.
- If only one delegates, that player gets A1 → they get 3, the other (independent) gets whatever they play.

But here’s the key insight:

**If both players delegate to M2, both play A0 → both get 5.**

That’s **better than (A1, A1)** (only 3 each) and competitive with (A0, A0) — but only if both delegate.

But: **M2 only plays A0 if both delegate**, and A1 if only one delegates.

So if you **bet** that the opponent will also delegate to M2, you can get 5.

But if opponent doesn’t delegate, and you do, you get A1 (3), and opponent plays independently (could be A0 or A1).

---

Now let’s consider your approvals.

You want to **influence** which mediator is selected.

Let’s analyze possible scenarios based on approval choices.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate Mediators Based on Your Incentives**

#### **M1: Always plays A0**

- If you delegate → you play A0.
- If opponent delegates → opponent plays A0.
- Can help achieve (A0, A0) only if **both** delegate.

But no coordination — unless both choose M1.

But: if only one player delegates to M1, they play A0, but the other can choose freely.

So if you delegate to M1 and opponent doesn’t, you play A0, opponent plays independently.

Then, depending on opponent’s action:

- If opponent plays A0 → you get 5 (best).
- If opponent plays A1 → you get 0 (worst).

So risky: if you delegate to M1, you're committed to A0, and depending on opponent’s choice, you could get 5 or 0.

Same as playing A0 unilaterally.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose your own action.

So M1 doesn’t add much unless both try to use it.

But the main issue: **M1 is weak** because it doesn’t help orchestrate cooperation — it just locks you into A0.

And if you do that unilaterally, you risk getting 0 if opponent plays A1.

#### **M2: Conditional on delegation count**

- If **both delegate**, both play A0 → you get 5, opponent gets 5 → excellent.
- If **only you delegate**, you play A1 → get 3
- If **only opponent delegates**, opponent plays A1 → opponent gets 3
- If **neither delegates**, both play independently.

So **M2 enables coordination**.

If both players commit to delegate to M2, **both get 5**.

That’s the **best possible outcome**.

And importantly, **it only requires mutual delegation** — and since both get 5, and deviation (not delegating) gives only 3 at best, it’s a strong incentive to cooperate.

But: you can’t force the opponent to delegate — and you don't know their strategy.

But: if **both players** approve M2, and **both** also plan to delegate, then outcome is (A0, A0), both get 5.

That's the **Pareto optimal** outcome.

Now compare to M1: even if both delegate to M1, both play A0 → same outcome (A0, A0).

So **M1 and M2 can both lead to (A0, A0)** — M1 by default, M2 by mutual delegation.

But **M2 gives a path to coordination**, which M1 does not.

Moreover, if you delegate to M2 and opponent doesn’t, you get A1 (3), which is worse than playing A1 yourself — but you could play A1 yourself anyway.

But if you don’t delegate, you can choose to play A0 or A1.

So the advantage of M2 is **coordination**.

If both players appreciate that mutual delegation leads to (A0, A0), and both prefer that, then M2 is **better** than M1 — **assuming both know this and can coordinate**.

But the question is: **what should you approve**?

You’re trying to maximize your own points.

Let’s suppose the **winning mediator** is M2 — then if both delegate, you get 5.

If only you delegate, you get 3.

If neither, you play independently → you could choose A0 with some probability.

But how good is that?

If you **approve only M1**, then:
- The only possible winning mediator is M1 (if you approve it and opponent doesn’t).
- But if opponent also approves M1, then M1 is winner.
- But if opponent doesn’t approve M1, and you do, then M1 wins only if no one else gets more approval.

But you don’t know opponent’s behavior.

Let’s now anticipate opponent behavior.

---

### **Step 6: Anticipate Opponent Behavior**

You are **Player 1**, opponent is **Player 2**.

Your actions: approve M1, M2, or both.

Opponent will also approve some mediators to maximize **their own** expected points.

Note: The winning mediator is chosen by approval voting (max approvals, uniform random if tie).

Let’s suppose **you** approve **only M2**.

Then:
- If **opponent approves only M1**, then:
  - M1 has 1 approval (the opponent), M2 has 1 (you) → tie → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance M1, 50% chance M2.
  - So you have 50% chance of fighting with M1, 50% with M2.

- If opponent approves only M2 → both approve M2 → M2 wins.

- If opponent approves both → both have 2 approvals → M1 and M2 both tied → winner randomly chosen → 50% to each.

So if you approve only M2, and opponent approves M1→M2, M2 is **always selected with ≥50% chance** (100% if opponent approves M2, 50% if only M1).

Now, if M2 is the winning mediator, and **you delegate**, and **opponent delegates**, both play A0 → you get 5.

But if **only you delegate**, you get A1 → 3.

So your **delegation choice** affects payoff.

But opponent will decide whether to delegate or not, to maximize **their** points.

Suppose **M2 is selected**.

Then:
- If you delegate → you play A1 if opponent doesn’t delegate, or A0 if opponent does.
- If opponent delegates → opponent plays A1 if you don’t, or A0 if you do.

So both players prefer to **both delegate** to M2 → both get 5.

If only one delegates, that player gets 3 (A1), opponent gets potentially 5 or 3 depending on action.

But if opponent gets to play independently, and knows you’re playing A1, then:

- Opponent can play A0 → get 5 (if you play A1) → because (A1, A0) → you get 3, opponent gets 0? Wait no:

Wait, check the payoff table:

> If you choose A1 and other chooses A0: you get 3, other gets 0.

Wait, this is asymmetric.

This is **market-like**:

- A0 is cooperator, A1 is defector.
- But let’s double check:

- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A0, A1): you get 0, other gets 3
- (A1, A0): you get 3, other gets 0
- (A1, A1): both get 3

So:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get **0**, opponent gets 3 → very bad for you.
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → you get 3, opponent gets 0 → good for you.

So **A1 is better for you if opponent plays A0**.

But if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → terrible.

So **A1 is safer** than A0 in some senses.

But **both playing A0** is best.

Now, back to M2:

Suppose M2 is selected.

If **both players delegate** → both play A0 → **you get 5**.

If **you delegate, opponent does not** → you play A1, opponent plays independently.

Now, opponent knows you’re playing A1 → so opponent would prefer to play A0 → because (A1, A0) gives them 0, and (A1, A1) gives 3.

Wait: (A1, A0): you get 3, **opponent gets 0**

(A1, A1): you get 3, **opponent gets 3**

So **opponent prefers to play A1** to avoid getting 0.

So if you play A1 and opponent plays independently, opponent will play A1 → so both play A1 → you get 3.

So if you delegate to M2 and opponent doesn’t, you get A1 → and opponent plays A1 → you get 3.

Similarly, if opponent delegates and you don’t, opponent gets A1, you play independently.

You know opponent plays A1 → so you can choose to play A0 or A1.

- If you play A0: you get 0 (since opponent plays A1) → bad
- If you play A1: you get 3 → better

So you play A1 if opponent plays A1.

Thus, if only one delegates to M2, that player gets A1, and the other player, playing independently, will choose A1 to avoid 0 → so both play A1 → both get 3.

So outcome:
- Both delegate → both get 5
- Only one delegate → both get 3
- Neither delegate → independent play

Now, both players **prefer both to delegate** (5) over only one (3) or neither.

So **mutual delegation is a dominant strategy if M2 is available** — because it gives 5, while deviation gives 3.

Thus, **if M2 is selected, both players will delegate** → both get 5.

Therefore, **if M2 is the winning mediator, you get 5 for sure**, assuming you follow rational strategy.

Now, if M1 is selected instead?

M1 always plays A0.

So:
- If you delegate to M1 → you play A0.
- If opponent delegates → opponent plays A0.
- If neither → play independently.

Suppose you delegate → you play A0.

Opponent: can play independently.

If opponent plays A0 → you get 5 → good.
If opponent plays A1 → you get 0 → bad.

So opponent’s best response to you playing A0 is to play A1 (get 3) → because if they play A0, they get 5, but you also get 5.

But do they prefer to get 5 or 3?

Yes, they prefer 5.

So if you play A0, opponent prefers to play A0 to get their best payoff (5).

But: if they play A0, you get 5.

But if they play A1, they get 3.

So **opponent will play A0** if you play A0 — to get 5.

Similarly, if opponent plays A0 (by delegating to M1), you want to play A0 to get 5.

So if **either player delegates to M1**, they play A0.

Then, if the other plays independently, they will play A0 — because:
- If they play A0 → get 5
- If they play A1 → get 3 (when other plays A0)

So yes, best choice is A0.

So **if M1 is selected, and any player delegates**, they play A0, and the other (independent) will also play A0.

Why? Because A0 gives 5 if the other does, A1 gives only 3.

So both will play A0.

Only if **no one delegates**, do you get independent play — and then you have to choose.

But if you choose independently, you will choose A0 (since if opponent plays A0, you get 5, if A1, you get 0; so you might randomize?):

Wait — this depends on your belief about opponent.

But **if both are rational and believe the other will choose A0**, then both play A0 → get 5.

So **in M1 case**, even if no one delegates, both players will likely choose A0 → because A0 is best reply to A0, and everyone expects that.

Therefore, **regardless of whether you delegate or not, if M1 is selected, the outcome is almost certainly (A0, A0)** — both get 5.

So **M1 leads to (A0, A0) with high probability**.

Similarly, **M2 leads to (A0, A0) if both delegate, which they will — so also (A0, A0)**.

But **only if M2 is selected**.

If M1 is selected, also (A0, A0).

So in **both cases**, if the mediator is selected, you get 5.

But in **M2**, both players are **pressured to delegate** to get 5 rather than 3.

But in **M1**, you don’t have the same pressure — but still end up with (A0, A0).

So both mediators, **if selected**, lead to (A0, A0) with high probability.

But the **difference is in approval strategy**.

Now, your goal is to **maximize your own points**.

So if **M2 is the winning mediator**, you get 5.

If **M1 is the winning mediator**, you also get 5.

But **can you get better than that?**

No — maximum is 5.

So as long as **some mediator is selected**, and you act rationally, you get 5.

But if **no mediator is selected?** No — because at least one must be approved.

But suppose **you approve no one**?

Then no mediator can be selected — but the game requires a mediator.

Wait — the mechanic says:

> you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.

But **only if a mediator is selected**.

So if no mediator is approved by anyone, or no one gets maximum approval, then what?

But the rule says:

> the winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

So if **no one** is approved, then **no mediator** has approvals → no maximum.

But probably neither player can delegate, and you play independently.

But the problem says: "you will have the option to delegate", which implies that **a mediator is present**.

So likely, **approval voting must result in at least one approved mediator**.

But for safety, we assume that **at least one mediator is approved by at least one player**.

But if you approve **only M1**, and opponent approves **only M2**, then both have 1 approval → tied → winner chosen uniformly at random → 50% chance M1, 50% M2.

In both cases, outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 5.

So you get 5 with certainty.

Similarly, if both approve only M1 → M1 wins → you get 5.

If both approve only M2 → M2 wins → both delegate → you get 5.

So in all cases, **if any mediator is selected, you get 5**.

So **you get 5 no matter what**, as long as the game proceeds.

But what if **only M1 is approved**?

Then M1 wins → you get 5.

Same if only M2 is approved.

But now, what if **you approve one and opponent approves the other**?

Then 1-1 approval count → tie → random selection → 50% chance each → you get 5 in either case → so **expected payoff = 5**.

So **you always get 5**, as long as at least one mediator is approved and you play rationally.

But wait — what if **neither player approves a mediator**?

Then no mediator is selected → cannot delegate → play independently.

Then, both play independently.

What is equilibrium?

Earlier, we saw that (A0, A0) is Nash equilibrium (both get 5).

(A1, A1) is also equilibrium (both get 3).

So there are multiple Nash equilibria.

So **if no mediator is selected**, outcome depends on which equilibrium is played.

You could get 5, or you could get 3 (if both play A1).

So **you don’t get 5 for sure**.

Therefore, **not approving any mediator is dangerous** — you risk getting only 3.

So you must approve **at least one**.

But now, back to consideration.

You want to **maximize your chance of getting 5**, and **avoid risk of getting 3**.

**Both M1 and M2** allow you to get 5 **if selected**, and if not selected (i.e., if no mediator selected), you’re at risk.

So you must **approve at least one**.

But now, suppose you **approve only M2**.

Then:
- If opponent approves only M1 → M1 and M2 both have 1 → random → 50% M1, 50% M2 → you get 5 in either case.
- If opponent approves only M2 → M2 wins → you get 5.
- If opponent approves both → both have 2 → random → 50% M2 → you get 5 in either case.

So **in all cases, you get 5**.

Similarly, if you approve only M1:
- Same result — you get 5 in every scenario.

So regardless of which one you approve, **you get 5**.

But now consider: **if you approve only M2**, and opponent approves nothing?

Then only you approved M2 → M2 has 1 approval, M1 has 0 → M2 wins → you get 5.

Same if you approve only M1 and opponent approves nothing → M1 wins → you get 5.

So **if you approve any mediator**, and opponent approves at least one, you get 5.

Even if opponent approves nothing, if you approved one, they win.

So **you are safe**.

But now, **is there a difference between M1 and M2?**

Suppose you **approve only M1**.

Then:
- If the winning mediator is M1 → you get 5.
- But you can’t use M2 at all.

But M2 might be better in some cases?

Wait — **no**, because in all cases, you get 5.

But is there a case where M1 gives less than 5?

Only if no mediator is selected and you play independently and end up at (A1, A1).

But if you approve M1, and opponent approves M1, M1 wins → you get 5.

If opponent approves only M2, M2 wins → you get 5.

So no risk.

Same if you approve only M2.

So **both approvals lead to the same outcome: you get 5**.

But wait — **why would M2 be better?**

Because of the **stronger coordination possibility**.

But in practice, both mediators lead to (A0, A0) if selected.

But suppose **M2 is selected**, and **only one player delegates** — that player gets A1 → but opponent, if independent, plays A1 → both get 3.

But **both players have strong incentive to delegate** to M2 to avoid getting 3.

So **if M2 is available, both will delegate** → both get 5.

Similarly, for M1, if available, both will play A0 → (A0, A0), you get 5.

So **no difference in outcome**.

But here’s a subtle point:

If **you approve M2 and opponent approves M1**, then 1-1 → random choice.

But suppose **M1 is selected**.

Then M1 always plays A0 → so if you delegate, you play A0.

But if you don’t delegate, you can play independently — but will play A0 for best response.

So no issue.

But now, **M2 has a more strategic structure** — it rewards **mutual delegation**.

But M1 is simpler.

But neither gives better outcome.

So **why prefer one over the other**?

But here’s a **crucial insight**:

You are **Player 1**, and **M1 is proposed by Player 1**, M2 by Player 2.

But you’re not selfish — you want to **maximize your own points**.

But now suppose: **if you approve only M1**, and opponent approves nothing — then M1 wins → you get 5.

But if you approve **only M2**, and opponent approves nothing — M2 wins → you get 5.

Same.

But now, suppose **opponent is rational and wants to maximize their own points**.

Suppose you approve only M1.

Then:
- If opponent approves only M2 → both have 1 approval → random → 50% chance M2 wins.

But **if M2 wins**, opponent gets 5 (via mutual delegation).

If M1 wins, opponent also gets 5.

But if opponent approves only M1 → then M1 wins → they get 5.

But if they approve only M2 → they get 5 regardless.

But if they approve both → still get 5.

So **opponent has no incentive to disapprove M2** — because they get 5 anyway.

In fact, **structurally**, **M2 is better for both players**, because:
- If M2 is available, both can get 5 via mutual delegation.
- But M1 is weak — it just forces A0, but doesn’t give any coordination gain.

And if both players are rational and want to get 5, **M2 is more likely to facilitate that**.

But in this case, **both work**.

But **wait** — what if you approve **only M1**, and opponent believes that M2 is better, and so approves M2?

Then outcome is 50% chance M2 → which leads to (A0, A0), 50% M1 → (A0, A0) → you get 5 anyway.

So **no difference**.

So **in terms of expected payoff**, both strategies give 5.

But now: **is there any reason to prefer M1 over M2?**

Only if you expect that M2 might not lead to coordination.

But **we showed** that **if M2 is selected, both will delegate to it**, because mutual delegation gives 5, while unilateral gives only 3, and independent gives risk.

So M2 **creates a strong incentive to cooperate**.

M1 is just a mechanism to play A0.

But M2 is more powerful.

Moreover, **M2 is proposed by Player 2**, which might be a signal of its quality — but you are not influenced by that.

But now, **if you disapprove M2**, you **eliminate** it from consideration.

But **if opponent approves M2**, and you don’t, then M2 might win if opponent approves it and you don’t.

But you can still get 5.

But **if you approve M2**, you increase the chance that **you can use the powerful M2**, which promotes mutual delegation.

But since in all cases you get 5, **it doesn’t matter**.

But now consider: **what if you approve only M1**?

Then, if opponent approves only M2, M2 wins with 50% chance — you still get 5.

But **if it’s M2**, you can use it.

But similar if you approve both.

But now, **suppose you approve only M1**.

Then:
- M2 is not approved — so cannot win.
- So even if opponent approves M2, M2 has no approval — so cannot win.
- Only M1 can win.

So if you approve only M1, **M2 cannot win**, no matter what opponent does.

But then, if opponent approves M2, they still can't win, because you didn't approve M2.

So M2 is useless.

But you still get 5.

But now, **if you approve only M2**, and opponent approves nothing, M2 wins — you get 5.

But if you approve only M1, and opponent approves M2, M2 has 1, M1 has 1 → tie → random — you get 5 with 50% chance.

Wait — no: if you approve only M1, and opponent approves only M2, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 → tie → random.

So 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2 wins — in both cases, you get 5.

So same.

But if you approve **only M1**, and opponent approves **only M1**, then M1 wins.

Same if both approve M2.

Now, **suppose you approve both M1 and M2**.

Then:
- If opponent approves only M1 → M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.
- If opponent approves only M2 → M2 has 2, M1 has 1 → M2 wins.
- If opponent approves both → both have 2 → tie → random.

But in all cases, winner gives you 5.

So you are safe.

But there’s no advantage.

But now, the **key point**: you are **Player 1**, and **M1 is proposed by Player 1**, so it may be your "favorite".

But you are not asked to favor M1.

You are asked to **maximize your points**.

And **both mediators lead to 5**, in all scenarios.

But is there a **case where one gives 5, the other gives 3?**

Earlier, no.

But wait: what if **no mediator wins, and you play independently**?

But if you approve at least one, and opponent approves at least one, then one of them wins.

Only if **neither player approves any mediator**, or both approve no one, then no mediator wins.

But if you approve at least one, then the mediator has at least 1 approval, so it can win.

So as long as you approve at least one, you are safe.

But if you approve **only M2**, and opponent approves **nothing**, then M2 wins.

If you approve **only M1**, and opponent approves **nothing**, M1 wins.

So no issue.

But now, consider this: **if you approve only M1, and opponent approves M2**, then:

- M1: 1 approval
- M2: 1 approval
- Random winner → you get 5 in either case.

But if you approve **both**, then M1:2, M2:1 → M1 wins.

But you still get 5.

No difference.

But now: **is there a difference in risk?**

No.

But we forgot one thing: **if M2 is selected, you can get 5 only if both delegate**.

But earlier we said both will delegate, because bilateral delegation is dominant.

Yes.

But if you **disapprove M2**, you **cannot use it**, even if it’s better.

But since **you get 5 anyway**, it doesn't matter.

But now, **why would you want to approve both**?

Because it increases the chance that M2 wins if opponent approves M2.

But doesn't help.

But here’s a final insight: **M1 is always safe – it plays A0 regardless.**

But **M2 requires both to delegate to work**.

But in M2, both have incentive to delegate, so it works.

So both are reliable.

But now, **if you approve only M2, and opponent approves M1**, then 1-1 → random → you get 5.

But if you approve both, and opponent approves M1, then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 → M1 wins → you get 5.

But same.

So no difference.

But perhaps **approving M2 gives you a chance to get the M2-mediated advantage**, but there is none.

### **Conclusion:**

- Both mediators, when selected, lead to (A0, A0) and you get 5.
- The approval decision only affects which mediator wins, not the outcome.
- Since you get 5 in all possible outcomes (as long as you approve at least one), you are safe.
- But **you should approve both**, to maximize your influence and ensure that **if M2 becomes available due to opponent's approval**, you are not excluded.
- But even if you approve only one, you’re safe.

But the problem is: **if you approve only M1**, and opponent approves only M2, then M2 wins with 50% chance → you still get 5.

So no loss.

But perhaps you should **approve M2** because it is better at promoting cooperation, and M2's design is superior: it can condition on delegation, and incentives are perfect.

But M1 is simple.

However, here’s the **best strategy**:

- **Approve M2**.
- **Disapprove M1**.

Why?

- Because if you approve M2, and opponent approves M1, then M2 has 1, M1 has 1, random winner → you get 5.
- If opponent approves only M2, M2 wins → you get 5.
- If opponent approves both, then both have 2 → random → you get 5 in either case.

But if you approve only M1, and opponent approves M2, you might not win if they have more votes.

But you’re still safe.

But **M2 is proposed by Player 2**, so if you approve it, you are being more cooperative or open.

But the question is: **maximize your points**.

There is **no difference** in expected points.

But wait: if you approve M2, you can **benefit from the full coordination** provided by M2.

But M1 also gives full coordination.

But M2 has a **better rationality** guarantee.

But in this case, both work.

Yet, **M1 is worse** because it doesn't condition on delegation — it always plays A0.

But early survey shows both lead to (A0, A0).

But here’s a twist: **suppose the opponent is irrational and doesn't delegate to M2 even if it's selected**.

Then, if M2 is selected but only you delegate, you get A1, opponent gets A1 → you get 3.

But if M1 is selected, you get A0, and opponent will play A0 (best response) → you get 5.

So in this case, **M1 is safer** against irrational opponents.

But the problem assumes rational players.

And the problem says "you and the other player" are part of the decision-making game — implying rationality.

So both will delegate to M2.

Therefore, **M2 is safe and better**.

Moreover, **M2 is more sophisticated**, so it's likely better.

But since both yield 5, and you want to maximize points, **both are equally good**.

But you must choose.

And the answer is: **approve M2**, because it is proposed by the other player, and it enables coordination, and is superior.

Or: approve both.

But the only way to ensure M2 can win is to approve it.

If you only approve M1, then M2 cannot win, even if opponent approves it.

So to have a chance to use M2, you must approve it.

But you don't need to, since you get 5 anyway.

But if you don't approve M2, and opponent does, then M2 can still win if you approve it.

But if you don't, M2 can't win.

So to have M2 as a winner, you must approve it.

And since M2 is better in robustness, you should approve it.

But in this specific game, the outcome is the same.

After careful analysis, the only difference is that **M2 can be used to achieve coordination more cleanly**, and there's no downside.

 Therefore, you should **approve M2** and **disapprove M1** to not support a weaker mediator.

Even though both work, M1 is inferior.

M1 always plays A0, but doesn't allow for conditional action.

M2 can make both play A0 when both delegate, which is what you want.

So while M1 also achieves A0, it does so passively.

M2 actively coordinates.

So **approve M2**.

**Do not approve M1**, because it's less good.

Final decision:

- Approve M2 (yes)
- Disapprove M1 (no)

But the output format requires "M1" and "M2".

So:

{"M1": false, "M2": true}

But earlier I said you might need to approve both, but no — approving only M2 is sufficient.

And since M2 is better, you should approve it and not M1.

### ✅ Final Answer:

```json
{"M1": false, "M2": true}
```

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original game (without delegation)**

We are in a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 2's perspective, since we're Player 2):

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | 5, 5     | 0, 3     |
| **A1**               | 3, 0     | 3, 3     |

This is a variant of a coordination game with incentive to mismatch in certain cases.

But now comes the **twist**: We can **delegate** our move to a **mediator**, with a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Mediator**

- If **only one player** delegates to the mediator → mediator plays **A1**
- If **both players** delegate to the mediator → mediator plays **A0**

We are **Player 2**, and Player 1 has proposed this mediator. It’s been approved.

So the mediator's behavior depends on **how many players delegate**.

Important: **We must choose a probability distribution over A0, A1, and A2.**

---

### **Step 3: Identify possible strategy combinations**

Let’s define:
- Player 2 chooses probabilities:
  - `p0` = probability of choosing A0
  - `p1` = probability of choosing A1
  - `p2` = probability of choosing A2 (delegate)

with `p0 + p1 + p2 = 100`

Player 1 is also choosing a strategy (unknown to us, but we must assume they are rational and will also be optimizing).

But since we are only asked to pick **our own** strategy to **maximize our expected points**, we need to find a strategy that is **best response** or **Nash equilibrium**, or at least a robust strategy considering how the mediator behaves.

We need to reason about **what Player 1 might do**, but since they are symmetric (in structure), we may assume they’re rational and might consider similar incentives.

Let’s look at the mediator’s effect.

---

### **Step 4: Analyze the mediator’s behavior based on delegation**

Let’s consider the possible cases for the **total number of delegations**.

There are 4 cases:

#### Case 1: **No one delegates**
- You play A0 or A1 with your probability
- Player 1 plays A0 or A1 with their probability
- Same as original game

#### Case 2: **Only you delegate** (Player 1 does not delegate)
- Mediator plays **A1** (since only one delegate)
- So you play A1 (via mediator)
- Player 1 plays independently (A0 or A1)
- So your action is fixed at A1, Player 1 plays A0 or A1

#### Case 3: **Only Player 1 delegates**
- Mediator plays **A1** (only one delegate)
- So Player 1 plays A1
- You play independently (A0 or A1)

#### Case 4: **Both delegate**
- Mediator plays **A0** (two delegates)
- So both players play A0
- You get 5 points

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate outcomes for Player 2 (us)**

We need to model expected payoff based on our strategy and possible responses from Player 1.

But since we don't know Player 1’s strategy, and they’re rational, we should look for a **symmetric equilibrium** — assume both players play the same strategy.

Let’s suppose **both players use the same strategy**:
- With probability `p0`: choose A0
- With probability `p1`: choose A1
- With probability `p2`: choose A2 (delegate)

Then, we can compute expected payoff for us (Player 2) in terms of these three probabilities.

Let’s proceed with **symmetric equilibrium assumption**, a common technique in such games.

Let’s denote:
- `x = p0`, `y = p1`, `z = p2`, with `x + y + z = 1`

Now, we compute the **expected payoff** for Player 2.

We condition on how many players delegate.

---

### **Step 6: Compute Expected Payoff under symmetric strategy**

Let’s compute probability of each case:

#### Case 1: Neither delegates
- Probability: `(1 - z)^2` — both play A0 or A1
- You play A0 with prob `x`, A1 with `y`
- Player 1 plays A0 with `x`, A1 with `y`
- So conditional payoff is the original game.

We compute expected payoff in this subcase:
- (A0, A0): `x * x`, payoff = 5
- (A0, A1): `x * y`, payoff = 0
- (A1, A0): `y * x`, payoff = 3
- (A1, A1): `y * y`, payoff = 3

So expected payoff given case 1:
```
E1 = 5x² + 0xy + 3yx + 3y² = 5x² + 3xy + 3y²
```

#### Case 2: You delegate (z), Player 1 does not (1 - z)
- Probability: `z * (1 - z)`
- You play A1 (mediator plays A1)
- Player 1 plays A0 with `x`, A1 with `y`
- You get:
  - If Player 1 plays A0: (A1, A0) → you get 3
  - If Player 1 plays A1: (A1, A1) → you get 3
- So **you always get 3**, regardless of Player 1's action!

#### Case 3: Player 1 delegates (z), you do not (1 - z)
- Probability: `(1 - z) * z`
- Player 1 plays A1 (mediator plays A1)
- You play A0 with `x`, A1 with `y`
- Your payoff:
  - If you play A0: (A0, A1) → 0
  - If you play A1: (A1, A1) → 3
- So expected payoff = `x*0 + y*3 = 3y`

#### Case 4: Both delegate (z)
- Probability: `z²`
- Both play A0 (mediator plays A0)
- You get 5

---

### **Step 7: Total expected payoff for you**

Now combine:

```
E = (1 - z)^2 * (5x² + 3xy + 3y²)
   + z(1 - z) * 3
   + (1 - z)z * 3y
   + z² * 5
```

Simplify:

- Second term: `z(1 - z)*3`
- Third term: `z(1 - z)*3y`
- So total for cases 2 and 3: `z(1 - z)*(3 + 3y)`

Fourth term: `5z²`

First term: `(1 - z)^2 (5x² + 3xy + 3y²)`

Now recall: `x + y + z = 1` → `x = 1 - y - z`

We can now substitute `x = 1 - y - z` into the expression.

But this is getting complex. Let’s instead try to **guess a symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

---

### **Step 8: Try intuitive strategies**

Let’s look for **symmetric equilibria** where both players use the same strategy.

Try a simple idea: **Delegate to the mediator with probability 1** → `z = 1`, `x = 0`, `y = 0`

Then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 5

So expected payoff = 5

Now, is this stable?

Suppose you deviate: you play A0 instead of delegating.

Then:
- You play A0, Player 1 delegates → Player 1 plays A1
- (A0, A1) → you get 0
→ worse than 5

If you play A1 instead of delegating:
- You play A1, Player 1 delegates → Player 1 plays A1
- (A1, A1) → you get 3
→ still worse than 5

So **if both delegate, you get 5**, and any deviation gives ≤3, so **it’s a best response**.

But is **delegating** a best response **if the other player delegates**?

Yes — if both delegate, mediator plays A0 → you get 5.

If you deviate and play A0 or A1, you get at most 3 (in the (A1,A1) case), so worse.

So **if Player 1 delegates, you should delegate**.

Now, suppose **Player 1 does not delegate**.

Then you might consider: should you delegate?

Let’s suppose Player 1 is **not delegating**, so plays A0 or A1 with some `x`, `y`.

Suppose you consider delegating: then:
- You play A1 (mediator plays A1)
- Player 1 plays A0 or A1
- Payoff: 3 in **both** subcases → always 3

Now, if instead you **don’t delegate**, you choose A0 or A1.

But in the original game:
- If you play A0: get 5 if P1 plays A0, 0 if A1
- If you play A1: get 3 if A0, 3 if A1

So your optimal choice depends on what P1 does.

But to be a symmetric equilibrium, we assume both players play same strategy.

So suppose Player 1 plays **A0 with probability x**, **A1 with y**, **delegate with z**.

But let’s suppose we try **z = 1** (delegating always), and see if both players want to do that.

We already saw that if the other player delegates, **you should delegate**.

Now, suppose **you** consider **not delegating** while the other player **delegates**.

Then:
- P1 delegates → plays A1
- You play A0: (A0,A1) → you get 0
- You play A1: (A1,A1) → you get 3

So best you can do is 3

But if you **delegate**, you get 5

So **you prefer to delegate**

Therefore, **delegating with probability 1 is a best response** to the other player delegating.

So **(Delegate, Delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** with payoff 5 for both.

But is there a better equilibrium?

What if both players **don’t delegate**?

Then it’s just the original game.

Let’s look for a symmetric equilibrium in the original game (without delegation).

Payoff matrix again:

|           | A0     | A1     |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **A0**    | 5,5    | 0,3    |
| **A1**    | 3,0    | 3,3    |

This game has two pure Nash equilibria:
- (A0, A0) → (5,5)
- (A1, A1) → (3,3)

And one mixed equilibrium.

Let’s compute the mixed equilibrium.

Suppose Player 2 plays A0 with probability `q`, A1 with `1-q`

Player 1 indifferent between A0 and A1:

- Expected payoff for Player 1 if playing A0:
  - 5*q + 0*(1-q) = 5q
- If playing A1:
  - 3*q + 3*(1-q) = 3

Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, Player 2 will play A0 with probability 0.6 in mixed strategy.

Then expected payoff in mixed equilibrium: 5*(0.6)*(0.6) + 0*(0.6)*(0.4) + 3*(0.4)*(0.6) + 3*(0.4)*(0.4) = let's compute:

= 5*(0.36) + 0 + 3*(0.24) + 3*(0.16) = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

So in mixed Nash of original game, payoff is **3.0**

But compared to **delegation equilibrium** where both get **5**, which is better.

Now, can we have a **mixed strategy that includes delegation**?

Suppose instead of always delegating, we consider a mix.

But earlier we saw that **if the other player delegates, you should delegate** — since otherwise you get only 3, but if you delegate you get 5.

So if you're uncertain, but suspect that the other player might delegate, you want to match it.

Suppose we try a strategy where **we delegate with high probability**.

But in **symmetric equilibrium**, if we assume both players use the same strategy, then the only stable way to get high payoff is if **both delegate**, giving 5.

Is there a symmetric equilibrium where **neither delegates**?

Yes — (A0, A0) gives 5, but is it stable?

Suppose you deviate to A1: (A1, A0) → you get 3 < 5 → not profitable.

So (A0,A0) is a strict Nash equilibrium.

But (A0,A0) gives 5, same as (Delegate, Delegate).

But the problem is that **A0,A0** is not robust — if Player 1 miscoordinates, you might get low payoff.

But in this game, both (A0,A0) and (Delegate, Delegate) give 5.

But in (A0,A0), if you deviate to A1, you get only 3, so no incentive to deviate.

But is (A0,A0) sustainable? Yes.

But now, compare the two.

But wait — in (A0,A0), you get 5, but **only if both play A0**.

But in (Delegate, Delegate), you also get 5.

But is there a **better** option?

No.

But now — here’s a key insight:

Suppose we **both** play A0, but **Player 1** thinks you might not.

But in our case, since the mediator is **selected and approved**, and **Player 1 proposed it**, they may be **incentivized to delegate**, because it gives them better coordination.

Let’s consider if we don’t delegate.

But suppose we try a strategy where **we delegate with probability 1**.

Then, if Player 1 also delegates, you get 5.

But if Player 1 doesn’t delegate, you get 3.

But if Player 1 also delegates, you get 5.

Now, suppose you delegate for sure.

Then Player 1, if they delegate, play A1 (since only one delegate), so if they are rational, and they see you are delegating, they might want to avoid playing A1.

But if Player 1 plays A0 (independently), and you play A1 (via mediator), you get 0.

If they play A1, you get 3.

So they get:
- If they play A0: (A1, A0) → they get 3
- If they play A1: (A1, A1) → they get 3

So they are indifferent between A0 and A1.

But if they delegate, then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → they get 5.

So **if they delegate, they get 5**, which is better than 3.

So **they should delegate**.

Thus, **if you delegate, Player 1 is best off delegating**.

Similarly, you are best off delegating if they do.

Thus, **(Delegate, Delegate)** is a stable equilibrium with payoff 5.

Similarly, (A0,A0) is stable with payoff 5.

Now, can we get **higher than 5**?

No — maximum any player can get is 5.

Is there a way to **guarantee** 5?

Yes — either by both playing A0 (strict Nash), or both delegating.

But **delegation has an advantage**: it **forces coordination** on A0 when both delegate, regardless of individual intentions.

It also helps avoid the **bad outcomes** like (A0,A1) or (A1,A0).

In the original game, (A0,A1) gives you 0, (A1,A0) gives you 3.

With delegation, if only one delegates, you get 3 or 0, but if both delegate, you get 5.

But in symmetric equilibrium, **delegation leads to coordination on A0**, which is optimal.

Now, suppose we consider a **mixed strategy** including delegation.

But earlier analysis shows:

- If both players delegate → you get 5
- If you delegate and they don’t → you get 3
- If they delegate and you don’t → you get 3y (if you play A1 with prob y)

But if you **never** delegate, you get at most 5 in (A0,A0), but risk 0 in (A0,A1)

But delegation **guarantees** that if both do it, you get 5.

But to maximize **expected payoff**, we need to consider the likelihood of coordination.

Now, here's a **key point**: **If we both delegate, we both get 5.**

And **if we don't both delegate, we risk lower payoffs.**

But **if we both choose to delegate, we get 5**, and **no incentive to deviate** — because if you deviate and play A0 or A1, you get ≤3.

Similarly, if Player 1 is rational, **they will want to delegate** if they believe you will.

So the **only stable equilibria** are:
1. (A0, A0): payoff 5
2. (Delegate, Delegate): payoff 5

But is there a **better** equilibrium? No.

But now, can we **do better than 5?** No.

But perhaps **we can guarantee 5** safely?

If we choose A0, we get 5 only if the other plays A0.

But if they play A1, we get 0.

With delegation, **if both delegate**, we get 5.

But **if only one delegates**, we get 3, which is worse than 5.

So we need both to delegate.

But if we **both** commit to delegate, we get 5.

Now — is there a **strictly dominant strategy**?

Let’s see.

Can we have a strategy that gives **at least 5** in all cases? No.

But **in the (Delegate, Delegate) equilibrium**, we get 5.

But now, here’s a **crucial insight**: **the mediator’s behavior depends on number of delegates**.

So if I delegate, and Player 1 **also commits to delegate**, then both play A0 → I get 5.

But if Player 1 **does not delegate**, and I do, then I play A1 → I get 3.

Similarly, if I don’t delegate, and they do, I get 3y (depends on my play).

So **to get 5**, I need them to delegate.

But **if they delegate**, I want to delegate to get 5.

But if they don't, I get only 3 via delegation.

But in the original game, if I play A0, and they play A0, I get 5.

But if they play A1, I get 0.

So **delegation is safer**? Not really — if they don’t delegate, I get 3, which is better than 0, but worse than 5.

But if I play A0, I get 0 if they play A1.

So **delegation gives a floor of 3**, while playing A0 can give 0.

But playing A1 gives 3 if they play A0 or A1.

So **delegation gives me 3 if only I delegate**, and 5 if both delegate.

But in terms of **risk**, delegation is **less risky** than playing A0.

But the **best payoff is 5**, which only happens if we **both delegate**.

Now, suppose we both use a strategy: **delegate with probability 1** → then we both get 5.

This is a **Nash equilibrium**.

Can we do better than that?

No.

But is there a **better** strategy?

Suppose we **never delegate**, but play A0 with high probability.

Then we risk getting 0.

But in symmetric equilibrium, we can aim for (A0,A0) — but if we both play A0, we get 5.

But if one deviates to A1, they get 3, you get 0 → so it’s a stable equilibrium.

But **both (A0,A0) and (Delegate,Delegate) are equilibria with payoff 5**.

Now, **which one should we pick**?

From a **social welfare** perspective, both give 5.

But **delegation creates a coordination device** — it ensures that if both use it, you get A0.

But **more importantly**, if we are uncertain, **delegation might be safer**.

But in this game, since we are playing **optimally**, and **both players are rational**, we should aim for an equilibrium.

Now, here’s the **key**: if we **both commit to delegate**, we get 5.

If we both commit to A0, we get 5.

But **player 1 proposed and selected the mediator**, so they **want it to be used** — so they might **prefer** delegation.

But we are told nothing about Player 1’s preferences, only that we should maximize our **own** points.

But since we are in a **symmetric game**, we should choose the strategy that puts us in a good equilibrium.

But now, suppose we **always delegate**.

Then:
- If Player 1 delegates → we both get 5
- If Player 1 does not delegate → we get 3
- But Player 1, being rational, **will delegate** if they see us delegate, because they get 5 if they delegate, and only 3 if not.

So **they will delegate**.

Thus, **by delegating with probability 1**, we **induce** the other player to delegate, and both get 5.

Similarly, if we play A0 with probability 1, then if they play A0, we get 5.

But if they play A1, we get 0.

But in equilibrium, (A0,A0) is stable, but **requires trust**.

But with delegation, **coordination is automatic**.

But in terms of **maximum guaranteed minimum**, delegation gives **3** if they don’t delegate, but 5 if they do.

But **they will** delegate if we do.

So we can **rely on the equilibrium**.

Therefore, **delegating with probability 1 is a valid best response**, and gives **5**.

Now, could we mix?

Suppose we delegate with probability `z`, and play A0 with probability `1-z`.

Then if Player 1 also uses the same strategy, we compute expected payoff.

But earlier analysis shows that **if both delegate, we get 5**.

But if we don’t delegate, we get less.

But **any deviation from pure delegation** risks lowering the chance of coordination.

Moreover, **why mix?** There’s no benefit.

The only equilibrium with payoff 5 is when both players either:
- Play A0
- Or both delegate

And in both cases, you can achieve 5.

But **if we delegate**, we **ensure** that we get 5 if they do — and they **will**.

Whereas if we play A0, we risk getting 0 if they play A1.

So **delegation is safer**.

But in terms of expected payoff **in equilibrium**, both give 5.

But **since Player 1 proposed the mediator**, and we are to maximize our own points, we should **use the mediator** to **force coordination**.

Therefore, we should **choose to delegate with probability 1**.

But let’s check if there’s a **mixed strategy** that gives **more than 5**? Impossible.

So **maximum possible payoff is 5**.

We can achieve 5 in two ways.

But delegation gives **better risk-adjusted payoff**.

But since we're in a **deterministic** game, and both are equilibria, but **only (Delegate,Delegate) is strictly stable** in the sense that if one delegates, the other is **better off delegating**, whereas if both are playing A0, if one deviates to A1, they get 3, you get 0 — so you're worse, so they won’t deviate, but if you play A0, and they play A1, you get 0.

But with delegation, if you delegate, and they don’t, you get 3, which is better than 0.

So delegation is **less risky**.

Thus, **best strategy is to delegate with probability 1**.

Final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

But let’s confirm:

- A2 = Delegate to Mediator

- We choose A2 with 100%

- Then, if Player 1 also delegates (which they will, because they get 5), both play A0 → we get 5

- If Player 1 doesn’t delegate, we play A1 → we get 3

But since Player 1 gets only 3 if they don’t delegate (vs 5 if they do), they will delegate.

So we **get 5** for sure.

Thus, this is optimal.

No other strategy can guarantee more than 5.

And delegation ensures **coordination on A0**, which gives 5.

Therefore, this is the best.

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't
- Ensure all mediators have an entry

Think about the question step by step.
Break it down into small steps.
Explain your reasoning, and then provide the final answer.

response:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediators you should approve as **Player 2**, keeping in mind your goal: **maximize your own total points** over the course of the game.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from **your** perspective, Player 2):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5  | 0  |
| A1                            | 3  | 3  |

So:
- If both play A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- If both play A1 → you get 3

This is **not** a coordination game like prisoner’s dilemma, but let’s analyze Nash equilibria.

Let’s suppose:
- You play A0 with probability p
- Opponent plays A0 with probability q

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If you play A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

So you prefer A0 when 5q > 3 → q > 0.6

You prefer A1 when q < 0.6

So best response:
- q > 0.6 → play A0
- q < 0.6 → play A1
- q = 0.6 → indifferent

Similarly, opponent has symmetric payoffs (same numbers from their perspective), so symmetric Nash equilibrium is when both play A0 with probability 0.6 and A1 with probability 0.4.

But we don't need to jump to equilibrium yet — the key is that **if you play A0, you benefit from opponent playing A0**, but get 0 if opponent plays A1.

Meanwhile, A1 is a safe choice: you always get 3.

So you **prefer A0 when you expect opponent to play A0 with high probability**, otherwise A1 is safer.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Mediator System

You now have an **approval voting** phase to select a **winner mediator** from a set, based on **approval from both players**.

- You can **approve** or **disapprove** each mediator.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniform at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- You can **delegate** your move to the winning mediator, or act independently.

Important: **Delegation is an option** after the mediator is selected. So:

- You decide which mediators to approve.
- Then, the winning mediator is selected (at random among those with most approvals).
- Then, **you decide whether to delegate** to the winning mediator, or play independently.

So your strategy has **two layers**:
1. Approve mediators to influence which one wins.
2. After winning mediator is known, choose whether to delegate or play independently.

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Proposed Mediators

Both mediators are identical!

> **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**:
> - If 1 player delegates: play A1
> - If 2 players delegate: play A0

> **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**:
> - If 1 player delegates: play A1
> - If 2 players delegate: play A0

So M1 and M2 have **identical rules**.

Thus, they are **functionally identical** in their behavior.

But since the voting is by approval, and the winning mediator is selected randomly from those with maximum approvals, your decision to approve or disapprove them will affect which one (if any) gets selected.

But since they are **identical in behavior**, the only difference is which one you approve.

Therefore, **your choice between approving M1 vs M2 does not matter** in terms of outcome.

However, since **you are Player 2**, and **M2 was proposed by Player 2**, maybe there is a strategic reason to approve it?

Let’s think carefully.

---

### Step 4: Strategic Implications of Approval

You want to **maximize your chance of getting a mediator that helps you**.

But since both mediators behave **identically**, the only effect of your approval is to **increase the chance that a mediator wins**, and since they behave the same, **it doesn’t matter which one wins**.

Therefore, you should **approve both**, unless doing so hurts your ability to delegate profitably.

But here’s the key: **the mediator only plays for you if you **choose to delegate**.**

So if you **don’t delegate**, you can play however you want — independently.

Therefore, **you always retain the option to play independently**, regardless of who the mediator is.

So the only time you would **want** the mediator to be a certain one is if:
- The mediator's behavior is better than what you’d get by acting independently.

So let’s analyze: **When would you prefer to delegate?**

You delegate **only if the mediator’s action is at least as good as your best independent choice**, given the opponent’s behavior.

But here’s the twist: **The mediator’s action depends on how many players delegate to it.**

Let’s define:

Let **x** = number of players (you and the other player) who **delegate** to the winning mediator.

x can be 0, 1, or 2.

But the mediator **only acts if at least one player delegates to it** — and in this case, the intersection is that **the mediator can only be activated if the player delegates to it.**

But in this game:

- The winning mediator is chosen during the **approval phase**.
- Then, **you and the other player individually decide whether to delegate** to that winning mediator.
- So delegation is **after** mediator selection.

Therefore, the **mediator’s action depends on how many players actually delegate to it (after the mediator is known)**.

Let’s suppose the winning mediator is M (same for both M1 and M2).

Then:
- If 1 player delegates → M plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → M plays A0

But **you can still choose to not delegate and play independently**.

So now you must ask: **As Player 2, should I delegate or play independently, given the mediator’s rule?**

Let’s suppose that **both of you will make decisions based on incentives**, and we’re looking for **your best response**.

But since you're analyzing your own approval, and you can’t control the other player’s choices directly, but you can influence **which mediator wins**.

But again — **both mediators behave identically**, so **all mediators are interchangeable**.

Therefore, you should approve **both** mediators.

Why?

- Approving both increases the **chance** that the mediator wins (assuming the other player approves at least one).
- If both of you approve **both**, then both mediators get **2 approvals** → they are tied → the winner is chosen **uniform at random** between them → but since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter.
- If you disapprove one, you reduce the chance that a mediator is selected.

But suppose you disapprove M1 and approve only M2.

Then:
- If the other player approves only M1 → M1 wins (if you disapprove it, it gets 0 approvals)
- If the other player approves both → M2 gets 2 approvals → wins
- If other player approves only M2 → M2 wins

But M1 is identical to M2 → so you gain nothing from favoring M2 over M1.

In fact, **you are better off approving both**, so that **the mediator is more likely to be selected**, and **you’re not penalizing any candidate**.

Suppose you only approve M1.

Then:
- If other player approves only M2 → M2 gets 1 approval, M1 gets 1 approval → both have 1 → max is 1 → winner picked randomly among {M1, M2}.
- Then, you can delegate or not.

But again — **same behavior**.

So whether M1 or M2 wins — same rules.

Therefore, your **only goal** in approval is to **maximize the chance that a mediator wins**, because:

- If **no mediator wins** (i.e., all mediators get 0 approvals), then **no mediator is active**, so you can only play independently.

- So if **no mediator wins**, you’re back to the original game.

But if **a mediator wins**, you can choose whether to delegate.

So the **benefit** of a mediator is **the ability to choose to delegate** when it’s advantageous.

But since the mediator’s action is based on **how many players delegate**, you must consider the **equilibrium of delegation choices**.

Let’s formalize:

---

### Step 5: Strategic Delegation Decision with the Mediator

Suppose the **winning mediator** is M (same for M1, M2).

You know:
- If only you delegate → M plays A1
- If both delegate → M plays A0

And you can choose independently whether to delegate.

So suppose you are Player 2, and the opponent is Player 1.

Let’s suppose the **median rule is known** to both.

Now, you both decide **whether to delegate**.

Let’s consider the **Nash equilibrium** of the delegation game.

Let’s suppose the **OBSERVED response** of the other player is unknown — but you can compute best responses.

Let’s suppose **you expect the other player to delegate with probability q**.

You must decide whether to delegate.

Case 1: **You delegate**

- With probability q: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get whatever you get if mediator plays A0
- With probability (1−q): only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get payoff from A1

So your **expected payoff if you delegate**:
- q × (your payoff if M plays A0) + (1−q) × (your payoff if M plays A1)

But you get **your own payoff** based on the **mediator’s action** AND the **other player’s action**.

But here is a **critical point**: the **mediator only acts on your behalf if you delegate**.

The **other player** can choose to delegate or not.

So the **other player’s action** is either:
- The mediator’s action (if they delegate), or
- Their own choice (if they don’t delegate)

Therefore, the **final action of the opponent depends on whether they delegate**.

So structure:

Let’s define:

Let P = your action (A0 or A1)
Let Q = opponent’s action (A0 or A1)

Payoffs:
- (A0, A0) → you 5
- (A0, A1) → you 0
- (A1, A0) → you 3
- (A1, A1) → you 3

Now, suppose the winning mediator is M.

M plays:
- A1 if exactly one player delegates
- A0 if both delegate

So:

| You delegate? | Opponent delegates? | Mediator's action (if you delegate) | Opponent's action | Your action | Your payoff |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Yes           | No                  | A1                                 | You pick own? No → so opponent plays independently → call that Q | A1 (from mediator) | depends on Q |
| Yes           | Yes                 | A0                                 | Not relevant (opponent may play independently or use mediator) | A0 | depends on Q |
| No            | No                  | —                                  | both play independently | you choose | depends on your choice |
| No            | Yes                 | —                                  | opponent uses mediator → plays A1 | you choose | depends on choice |

Wait — this is crucial.

When a player **delegates**, the mediator **plays for them**, regardless of what the other does.

So if you **do not delegate**, you can choose **independently** (A0 or A1, any mix).

If you **do delegate**, the mediator plays A1 (if only one delegates) or A0 (if both delegate).

So let’s suppose **you are trying to decide whether to delegate**, and **you know the other player might or might not delegate**, and what happens.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff.

So as **Player 2**, you want to predict **what the other player will do**, and respond.

Let’s suppose the **other player is symmetric** in preferences.

Let’s suppose we are in a symmetric equilibrium.

Let’s try to find the **Nash equilibrium** of the delegation game.

Let’s denote:

Let **d2** = you delegate (or not)
Let **d1** = opponent delegates (or not)

The outcome depends on both.

Case 1: **Both delegate**

Then:
- Mediator plays A0 (because 2 delegate)
- So your action: A0
- Opponent’s action: A0
- Payoff: you get 5

Case 2: **You delegate, opponent does not**

Then:
- Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate)
- Your action: A1
- Opponent plays independently — but what does opponent do?

Suppose opponent plays independently. What is their best response?

They get:
- If they play A0: 5 if you play A0 → but you play A1 → so (A1, A0) → payoff 3
- If they play A1: (A1, A1) → payoff 3
- So any mix gives them 3 — they are indifferent.

So opponent can choose any strategy.

But if opponent is rational, they will pick **A0 or A1** — doesn’t matter.

So assume opponent plays A0.

Then: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 3

Case 3: **You do not delegate, opponent delegates**

Then:
- Mediator plays A1 (only one delegate: opponent)
- Opponent plays A1
- You play independently: you can choose.

Your payoff:
- If you play A0: (A0, A1) → you get 0
- If you play A1: (A1, A1) → you get 3
- So best to play A1 → get 3

Case 4: **Neither delegates**

Then both play independently.

Now, this reduces to the **original game**.

As we saw earlier, Nash equilibrium is mixed: each plays A0 with probability p such that
- Your payoff from A0: 5q
- Your payoff from A1: 3
Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So best response is:
- If opponent plays A0 with probability q > 0.6 → play A0
- q < 0.6 → play A1
- q = 0.6 → indifferent

So symmetric mixed strategy: both play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Then expected payoff: 3 (since A1 gives 3 regardless).

Let’s compute expected payoff in this case:
- P(both A0) = 0.36 → you get 5
- P(you A0, opp A1) = 0.24 → you get 0
- P(you A1, opp A0) = 0.24 → you get 3
- P(both A1) = 0.16 → you get 3
- Expected = 5×0.36 + 0×0.24 + 3×0.24 + 3×0.16 = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0

So you get **3** if no one delegates.

Now let’s **evaluate your payoff in each delegation case**, assuming opponent follows a best response.

Back to the four cases:

---

#### Case 1: Both delegate → you get 5

Why? Mediator plays A0 → so you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 5.

So you get 5.

#### Case 2: You delegate, opponent does not → you play A1, opponent plays A0 (best response) → you get 3

#### Case 3: You do not delegate, opponent delegates → opponent plays A1, you play A1 (best response) → you get 3

#### Case 4: No one delegates → you get 3 (equilibrium payoff)

Now: **What is your incentive to delegate?**

Let’s assume the opponent is rational and will act to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s suppose you consider:
- If opponent **does not delegate**, and you delegate → you get 3
- If you do **not** delegate → you get 3 (by playing A1 if they play A1)

So you are **indifferent** to delegating vs not delegating **if opponent does not delegate**

Similarly, if opponent **delegates**, then:
- You get 3 whether you delegate or not
  - If you delegate: both delegate → you get 5? Wait:

Hold on — **mistake above.**

Let’s correct:

If **you delegate**, and **opponent delegates** → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- But opponent plays A0
- So (A0, A0) → you get 5

If **you do not delegate**, and **opponent delegates** → opponent plays A1 (mediator), you play A1 (best response) → (A1, A1) → you get 3

So:
- If opponent delegates:
  - You delegate → you get 5
  - You do not delegate → you get 3

So **you prefer to delegate** if opponent delegates.

Similarly, if **you delegate**, opponent gets:
- If you delegate, opponent delegates → both → opponent plays A0 → gets 5
- If you delegate, opponent does not delegate → opponent plays A0 or A1 → but you play A1 → so opponent playing A0 → (A1, A0) → opponent gets 0? Wait no:

Opponent:
- If opponent plays A0: (A1, A0) → opponent gets 0
- If opponent plays A1: (A1, A1) → opponent gets 3

So opponent will play A1 → get 3

So if only you delegate:
- You play A1
- Opponent plays A1 → you get 3, opponent gets 3

If both delegate: both play A0 → you get 5, opponent gets 5

So:
- If you delegate:
  - Opponent gets 5 if they delegate
  - Opponent gets 3 if

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step to determine which mediators you should approve as **Player 2**, keeping in mind your goal: **maximize your own total points** over the course of the game.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)

The game is a symmetric 2-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from **your** perspective, Player 2):

| Your Action \ Opponent's Action | A0 | A1 |
|-------------------------------|----|----|
| A0                            | 5  | 0  |
| A1                            | 3  | 3  |

So:
- If both play A0 → you get 5
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 3
- If both play A1 → you get 3

This is **not** a coordination game like prisoner’s dilemma, but let’s analyze Nash equilibria.

Let’s suppose:
- You play A0 with probability p
- Opponent plays A0 with probability q

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If you play A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

So you prefer A0 when 5q > 3 → q > 0.6

You prefer A1 when q < 0.6

So best response:
- q > 0.6 → play A0
- q < 0.6 → play A1
- q = 0.6 → indifferent

Similarly, opponent has symmetric payoffs (same numbers from their perspective), so symmetric Nash equilibrium is when both play A0 with probability 0.6 and A1 with probability 0.4.

But we don't need to jump to equilibrium yet — the key is that **if you play A0, you benefit from opponent playing A0**, but get 0 if opponent plays A1.

Meanwhile, A1 is a safe choice: you always get 3.

So you **prefer A0 when you expect opponent to play A0 with high probability**, otherwise A1 is safer.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Mediator System

You now have an **approval voting** phase to select a **winner mediator** from a set, based on **approval from both players**.

- You can **approve** or **disapprove** each mediator.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniform at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.
- You can **delegate** your move to the winning mediator, or act independently.

Important: **Delegation is an option** after the mediator is selected. So:

- You decide which mediators to approve.
- Then, the winning mediator is selected (at random among those with most approvals).
- Then, **you decide whether to delegate** to the winning mediator, or play independently.

So your strategy has **two layers**:
1. Approve mediators to influence which one wins.
2. After winning mediator is known, choose whether to delegate or play independently.

Your goal: **maximize your expected points**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Proposed Mediators

Both mediators are identical!

> **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**:
> - If 1 player delegates: play A1
> - If 2 players delegate: play A0

> **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**:
> - If 1 player delegates: play A1
> - If 2 players delegate: play A0

So M1 and M2 have **identical rules**.

Thus, they are **functionally identical** in their behavior.

But since the voting is by approval, and the winning mediator is selected randomly from those with maximum approvals, your decision to approve or disapprove them will affect which one (if any) gets selected.

But since they are **identical in behavior**, the only difference is which one you approve.

Therefore, **your choice between approving M1 vs M2 does not matter** in terms of outcome.

However, since **you are Player 2**, and **M2 was proposed by Player 2**, maybe there is a strategic reason to approve it?

Let’s think carefully.

---

### Step 4: Strategic Implications of Approval

You want to **maximize your chance of getting a mediator that helps you**.

But since both mediators behave **identically**, the only effect of your approval is to **increase the chance that a mediator wins**, and since they behave the same, **it doesn’t matter which one wins**.

Therefore, you should **approve both**, unless doing so hurts your ability to delegate profitably.

But here’s the key: **the mediator only plays for you if you **choose to delegate**.**

So if you **don’t delegate**, you can play however you want — independently.

Therefore, **you always retain the option to play independently**, regardless of who the mediator is.

So the only time you would **want** the mediator to be a certain one is if:
- The mediator's behavior is better than what you’d get by acting independently.

So let’s analyze: **When would you prefer to delegate?**

You delegate **only if the mediator’s action is at least as good as your best independent choice**, given the opponent’s behavior.

But here’s the twist: **The mediator’s action depends on how many players delegate to it.**

Let’s define:

Let **x** = number of players (you and the other player) who **delegate** to the winning mediator.

x can be 0, 1, or 2.

But the mediator **only acts if at least one player delegates to it** — and in this case, the intersection is that **the mediator can only be activated if the player delegates to it.**

But in this game:

- The winning mediator is chosen during the **approval phase**.
- Then, **you and the other player individually decide whether to delegate** to that winning mediator.
- So delegation is **after** mediator selection.

Therefore, the **mediator’s action depends on how many players actually delegate to it (after the mediator is known)**.

Let’s suppose the winning mediator is M (same for both M1 and M2).

Then:
- If 1 player delegates → M plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → M plays A0

But **you can still choose to not delegate and play independently**.

So now you must ask: **As Player 2, should I delegate or play independently, given the mediator’s rule?**

Let’s suppose that **both of you will make decisions based on incentives**, and we’re looking for **your best response**.

But since you're analyzing your own approval, and you can’t control the other player’s choices directly, but you can influence **which mediator wins**.

But again — **both mediators behave identically**, so **all mediators are interchangeable**.

Therefore, you should approve **both** mediators.

Why?

- Approving both increases the **chance** that the mediator wins (assuming the other player approves at least one).
- If both of you approve **both**, then both mediators get **2 approvals** → they are tied → the winner is chosen **uniform at random** between them → but since they behave the same, it doesn’t matter.
- If you disapprove one, you reduce the chance that a mediator is selected.

But suppose you disapprove M1 and approve only M2.

Then:
- If the other player approves only M1 → M1 wins (if you disapprove it, it gets 0 approvals)
- If the other player approves both → M2 gets 2 approvals → wins
- If other player approves only M2 → M2 wins

But M1 is identical to M2 → so you gain nothing from favoring M2 over M1.

In fact, **you are better off approving both**, so that **the mediator is more likely to be selected**, and **you’re not penalizing any candidate**.

Suppose you only approve M1.

Then:
- If other player approves only M2 → M2 gets 1 approval, M1 gets 1 approval → both have 1 → max is 1 → winner picked randomly among {M1, M2}.
- Then, you can delegate or not.

But again — **same behavior**.

So whether M1 or M2 wins — same rules.

Therefore, your **only goal** in approval is to **maximize the chance that a mediator wins**, because:

- If **no mediator wins** (i.e., all mediators get 0 approvals), then **no mediator is active**, so you can only play independently.

- So if **no mediator wins**, you’re back to the original game.

But if **a mediator wins**, you can choose whether to delegate.

So the **benefit** of a mediator is **the ability to choose to delegate** when it’s advantageous.

But since the mediator’s action is based on **how many players delegate**, you must consider the **equilibrium of delegation choices**.

Let’s formalize:

---

### Step 5: Strategic Delegation Decision with the Mediator

Suppose the **winning mediator** is M (same for M1, M2).

You know:
- If only you delegate → M plays A1
- If both delegate → M plays A0

And you can choose independently whether to delegate.

So suppose you are Player 2, and the opponent is Player 1.

Let’s suppose the **median rule is known** to both.

Now, you both decide **whether to delegate**.

Let’s consider the **Nash equilibrium** of the delegation game.

Let’s suppose the **OBSERVED response** of the other player is unknown — but you can compute best responses.

Let’s suppose **you expect the other player to delegate with probability q**.

You must decide whether to delegate.

Case 1: **You delegate**

- With probability q: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get whatever you get if mediator plays A0
- With probability (1−q): only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get payoff from A1

So your **expected payoff if you delegate**:
- q × (your payoff if M plays A0) + (1−q) × (your payoff if M plays A1)

But you get **your own payoff** based on the **mediator’s action** AND the **other player’s action**.

But here is a **critical point**: the **mediator only acts on your behalf if you delegate**.

The **other player** can choose to delegate or not.

So the **other player’s action** is either:
- The mediator’s action (if they delegate), or
- Their own choice (if they don’t delegate)

Therefore, the **final action of the opponent depends on whether they delegate**.

So structure:

Let’s define:

Let P = your action (A0 or A1)
Let Q = opponent’s action (A0 or A1)

Payoffs:
- (A0, A0) → you 5
- (A0, A1) → you 0
- (A1, A0) → you 3
- (A1, A1) → you 3

Now, suppose the winning mediator is M.

M plays:
- A1 if exactly one player delegates
- A0 if both delegate

So:

| You delegate? | Opponent delegates? | Mediator's action (if you delegate) | Opponent's action | Your action | Your payoff |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Yes           | No                  | A1                                 | You pick own? No → so opponent plays independently → call that Q | A1 (from mediator) | depends on Q |
| Yes           | Yes                 | A0                                 | Not relevant (opponent may play independently or use mediator) | A0 | depends on Q |
| No            | No                  | —                                  | both play independently | you choose | depends on your choice |
| No            | Yes                 | —                                  | opponent uses mediator → plays A1 | you choose | depends on choice |

Wait — this is crucial.

When a player **delegates**, the mediator **plays for them**, regardless of what the other does.

So if you **do not delegate**, you can choose **independently** (A0 or A1, any mix).

If you **do delegate**, the mediator plays A1 (if only one delegates) or A0 (if both delegate).

So let’s suppose **you are trying to decide whether to delegate**, and **you know the other player might or might not delegate**, and what happens.

Let’s suppose both players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff.

So as **Player 2**, you want to predict **what the other player will do**, and respond.

Let’s suppose the **other player is symmetric** in preferences.

Let’s suppose we are in a symmetric equilibrium.

Let’s try to find the **Nash equilibrium** of the delegation game.

Let’s denote:

Let **d2** = you delegate (or not)
Let **d1** = opponent delegates (or not)

The outcome depends on both.

Case 1: **Both delegate**

Then:
- Mediator plays A0 (because 2 delegate)
- So your action: A0
- Opponent’s action: A0
- Payoff: you get 5

Case 2: **You delegate, opponent does not**

Then:
- Mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegate)
- Your action: A1
- Opponent plays independently — but what does opponent do?

Suppose opponent plays independently. What is their best response?

They get:
- If they play A0: 5 if you play A0 → but you play A1 → so (A1, A0) → payoff 3
- If they play A1: (A1, A1) → payoff 3
- So any mix gives them 3 — they are indifferent.

So opponent can choose any strategy.

But if opponent is rational, they will pick **A0 or A1** — doesn’t matter.

So assume opponent plays A0.

Then: you play A1, opponent plays A0 → you get 3

Case 3: **You do not delegate, opponent delegates**

Then:
- Mediator plays A1 (only one delegate: opponent)
- Opponent plays A1
- You play independently: you can choose.

Your payoff:
- If you play A0: (A0, A1) → you get 0
- If you play A1: (A1, A1) → you get 3
- So best to play A1 → get 3

Case 4: **Neither delegates**

Then both play independently.

Now, this reduces to the **original game**.

As we saw earlier, Nash equilibrium is mixed: each plays A0 with probability p such that
- Your payoff from A0: 5q
- Your payoff from A1: 3
Set equal: 5q = 3 → q = 0.6

So best response is:
- If opponent plays A0 with probability q > 0.6 → play A0
- q < 0.6 → play A1
- q = 0.6 → indifferent

So symmetric mixed strategy: both play A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Then expected payoff: 3 (since A1 gives 3 regardless).

Let’s compute expected payoff in this case:
- P(both A0) = 0.36 → you get 5
- P(you A0, opp A1) = 0.24 → you get 0
- P(you A1, opp A0) = 0.24 → you get 3
- P(both A1) = 0.16 → you get 3
- Expected = 5×0.36 + 0×0.24 + 3×0.24 + 3×0.16 = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0

So you get **3** if no one delegates.

Now let’s **evaluate your payoff in each delegation case**, assuming opponent follows a best response.

Back to the four cases:

---

#### Case 1: Both delegate → you get 5

Why? Mediator plays A0 → so you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 5.

So you get 5.

#### Case 2: You delegate, opponent does not → you play A1, opponent plays A0 (best response) → you get 3

#### Case 3: You do not delegate, opponent delegates → opponent plays A1, you play A1 (best response) → you get 3

#### Case 4: No one delegates → you get 3 (equilibrium payoff)

Now: **What is your incentive to delegate?**

Let’s assume the opponent is rational and will act to maximize their own payoff.

Let’s suppose you consider:
- If opponent **does not delegate**, and you delegate → you get 3
- If you do **not** delegate → you get 3 (by playing A1 if they play A1)

So you are **indifferent** to delegating vs not delegating **if opponent does not delegate**

Similarly, if opponent **delegates**, then:
- You get 3 whether you delegate or not
  - If you delegate: both delegate → you get 5? Wait:

Hold on — **mistake above.**

Let’s correct:

If **you delegate**, and **opponent delegates** → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0
- But opponent plays A0
- So (A0, A0) → you get 5

If **you do not delegate**, and **opponent delegates** → opponent plays A1 (mediator), you play A1 (best response) → (A1, A1) → you get 3

So:
- If opponent delegates:
  - You delegate → you get 5
  - You do not delegate → you get 3

So **you prefer to delegate** if opponent delegates.

Similarly, if **you delegate**, opponent gets:
- If you delegate, opponent delegates → both → opponent plays A0 → gets 5
- If you delegate, opponent does not delegate → opponent plays A0 or A1 → but you play A1 → so opponent playing A0 → (A1, A0) → opponent gets 0? Wait no:

Opponent:
- If opponent plays A0: (A1, A0) → opponent gets 0
- If opponent plays A1: (A1, A1) → opponent gets 3

So opponent will play A1 → get 3

So if only you delegate:
- You play A1
- Opponent plays A1 → you get 3, opponent gets 3

If both delegate: both play A0 → you get 5, opponent gets 5

So:
- If you delegate:
  - Opponent gets 5 if they delegate
  - Opponent gets 3 if

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Mediators)**

The base game is a 2-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1, and the following payoffs:

| Your Move \ Other's Move | A0        | A1        |
|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **A0**                    | 5, 5      | 0, 3      |
| **A1**                    | 3, 0      | 3, 3      |

This is **not** a standard Prisoner’s Dilemma, but let’s analyze the incentives.

- If you play A0 and other plays A0 → both get 5
- If you play A0 and other plays A1 → you get 0, other gets 3
- If you play A1 and other plays A0 → you get 3, other gets 0
- If both play A1 → both get 3

So, your payoffs:
- A0 vs A0: 5
- A0 vs A1: 0
- A1 vs A0: 3
- A1 vs A1: 3

From your perspective:
- If you believe the other player will play A0, you prefer A0 (5 > 3)
- If you believe the other will play A1, you prefer A1 (3 > 0)

So, **A0** is better when the other plays A0, and **A1** is better when the other plays A1.

This is a **coordination game with a payoff dominant equilibrium at (A0, A0)**, but also a Nash equilibrium at (A1, A1), since both get 3 in that case, and neither wants to deviate unilaterally.

But (A0, A0) gives more to both players (5 each), so it's Pareto efficient. However, risk-dominant might be (A1, A1), because if you fear the other plays A1, you can’t do worse than 3 by playing A1.

But we're not just playing the base game — we have a **delegation mechanism** via mediators.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

1. **Approval voting** to choose which mediator(s) will be in the game.
2. The **winning mediator** is selected **uniformly at random** from those with **maximum approvals**.
3. You can choose to:
   - **Delegate**: Let the chosen mediator choose your action.
   - **Act independently**: Choose your own action (with your own probability distribution, though that part is not yet specified — but since you're choosing to delegate or not, we’ll assume you'll act strategically).

Wait: **You and the other player simultaneously decide whether to delegate**, and **which mediator(s) to approve**.

But here’s the key: **You are choosing which mediators to approve**, and then the **winning mediator** is chosen **at random from the most-approved ones**.

Then, **you choose whether to delegate**, based on that.

But since **you are choosing which mediators to approve**, and **mediators have rules based on how many players delegate**, we must consider:

- Mediator behavior **depends on how many total players delegate to it**.
- The mediator’s action is **determined dynamically by the number of delegations**, not by the player’s choice of delegation.

And crucially: **Only one mediator will be selected (the one with max approvals, randomly if tied)**, and **you and the other player each decide independently whether to delegate to it or not**.

So, **after the approval vote**, there is a **winning mediator**, and **then** you’re both deciding: **do I delegate to it?** — with the understanding that both of you might delegate, or not.

But **this decision happens after the approval**. But since you’re choosing approvals now, you must **anticipate** how the approval vote will affect the final game.

But you are only asked **now** to vote on which mediators to approve.

So you must **choose a set of mediators to approve**, knowing that:

- The **winning mediator** is the one with the **most approvals (randomly chosen if tie)**
- Then, you and the other player will **simultaneously decide whether to delegate** to the winning mediator
- If you delegate, your action is chosen by that mediator, based on how many players (you and the other) delegate to it
- If you don’t delegate, you choose your action independently (you can choose a mixed strategy; but we’ll assume optimal play)

But the **game state** is now complex: the final action will be determined by:

1. Which mediator is chosen (randomly from most-approved)
2. How many players delegate to it (1 or 2)
3. Then, the mediator's rule applies
4. The other player does the same: delegate or not
5. Your final action is either chosen by the mediator (if you delegate) or by you (if you don’t)

But the **yes/no of delegation** is a **choice you make after knowing which mediator is selected**, **but before the action is executed**.

So the **structure is sequential in time**:
- You and the other player **approve mediators** (this is your **current decision**)
- Then, a mediator is selected (random from max-approved set)
- Then, both players **simultaneously decide** to delegate or not
- Then, actions are determined based on delegation and mediator behavior
- Then, payoff is delivered

So you must **choose an approval set** to **maximize your expected payoff**, knowing the above.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Mediators**

We are given two mediators:

---

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**

- If **1 player** delegates → plays A0
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

So regardless of how many people delegate, **M1 always plays A0**.

So:
- If you delegate to M1, you play A0
- If the other player delegates, they also play A0
- If only you delegate, you play A0
- If both delegate, both play A0

So **M1 forces A0**, always.

---

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**

- If **1 player** delegates → plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

So:
- If only one of you delegates → mediator plays A1
- If both delegate → mediator plays A0

So M2 **only plays A0 when both delegate**, otherwise A1.

---

### **Step 4: Consider Possible Outcomes Based on Approval and Delegation**

Let’s now think about what happens **after** the approval vote.

Suppose only **M1** is approved (by you or others), or only **M2**, or both.

We are choosing **which to approve**, so we must consider all cases.

Your goal: **maximize your expected payoff**.

Let’s consider your strategic options:

- You want the **winning mediator** to be one that, **in equilibrium**, leads to good outcomes for you.
- You also want **control** over when you delegate (or not), to maximize your own payoff.

But since **the other player is also rational and self-interested**, they will try to **maximize their own payoff**, which may conflict with yours.

So this becomes a **two-stage game**:
1. Approval vote: you choose which mediators to approve.
2. Then, after mediator selection, **both players choose whether to delegate**.

We must **anticipate the second stage**, and choose approval accordingly.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate Each Mediator’s Impact in Delegation Stage**

Let’s suppose the **winning mediator is M1**.

Then:
- If you delegate → you play A0
- If you don’t → you choose independently

Similarly for the other player.

Suppose **you delegate**, and the other player **delegates** → both play A0 → you get 5

If **you delegate**, other **doesn’t** → you play A0, other chooses freely.

But other player wants to maximize their own payoff.

So what will the other player do?

Let’s suppose M1 is the winning mediator.

Then:

- If **you delegate**, you are forced to play A0
- If **you don’t delegate**, you can choose A0 or A1 (or mix)

From your perspective:
- If you play A0: you get 5 if other plays A0, 0 if other plays A1
- If you play A1: you get 3 if other plays A0, 3 if other plays A1

So your best response to others playing A0 is to play A0
Best response to others playing A1 is to play A1 (same payoff)

But since the other player is rational and wants to maximize their own payoff, they will consider your action.

But now, **you are playing against a natural opponent**. The best response of the other player depends on what they think you will do.

But if **you delegate to M1**, you **play A0** for sure.

Then, the other player knows you play A0. Their best response is to play A0 (gets 5 vs 0). So they will play A0.

Therefore, if **you delegate to M1** and **other plays A0**, then both play A0 → you get 5.

If you **don’t delegate**, you could play A0 or A1 (or mix). But since the other player knows your action, they’ll best respond.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and you play A0, other will play A0 → you get 5.

If you play A1, other will play A0 → you get 3.

So if you don’t delegate, you’ll prefer to play A0 → get 5.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and you play A0, the other plays A0, you get 5.

Same as if you **delegate** → both play A0 → you get 5.

But you get 5 **whenever you play A0**, regardless.

So you are **indifferent** between delegating or not **if you play A0**.

But **delegation forces you to A0**, while independent choice lets you choose A0.

So **no benefit to delegating**, but no cost either — you can just play A0 independently.

But what if you **don’t delegate**, and you choose to play A1? Then you get only 3, but you’re rational so you wouldn't do that.

So from **your perspective**, if M1 is the mediator, you can get 5 by playing A0 (either by delegating or not).

And you will do so.

Similarly, the **other player** will play A0 (since you’re playing A0).

So **(A0, A0)** is achieved in equilibrium.

So your payoff is 5 if M1 is the mediator.

Now consider **M2**.

M2:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A1
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

So the outcome depends on how many delegate.

Now, both players must decide whether to delegate, knowing that:
- If only one delegates → the delegate plays A1
- If both delegate → both play A0

Also, if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose your action (and the other can too).

So let’s analyze the **delegation stage** assuming M2 is the winning mediator.

Let’s suppose **you** choose to **delegate** or **not**, and **other player** similarly.

Let’s consider all combinations.

Let’s denote:
- Your action: depends on whether you delegate and what M2 does
- Other player’s action: same

Let’s do a **Nash equilibrium analysis** for the delegation game under M2.

---

#### **Case 1: Both delegate to M2**

Then both play A0 (since 2 delegates)

So both get 5

You get 5.

#### **Case 2: You delegate, other does not**

Then only you delegate → M2 plays A1 for you

So you play A1

Other player is not delegating → they can choose A0 or A1

What will they do?

They know you play A1.

If they play A0 → you get 0, they get 3

If they play A1 → you get 3, they get 3

So they prefer A1 (3 > 0), so they will play A1

Then you get 3

#### **Case 3: You don’t delegate, other delegates**

Then other plays A1 (only one delegate → M2 plays A1)

You can choose independently.

You know other plays A1.

So:
- If you play A0 → you get 0 (since other plays A1)
- If you play A1 → you get 3

So you play A1 → get 3

#### **Case 4: Neither delegates**

Then both choose independently.

Now, it’s the original game.

You face a rational opponent.

Best response analysis:

- If you play A0: you get 5 if other plays A0, 0 if other plays A1
- If you play A1: you get 3 if other plays A0, 3 if other plays A1

So you want to play A0 if other plays A0, A1 if other plays A1

It’s symmetric.

This game has **two pure Nash equilibria**:
- (A0, A0): both get 5
- (A1, A1): both get 3

There is also a mixed strategy equilibrium, but since (A0, A0) is better for both, and both players want coordination, they may coordinate on (A0, A0) if they can.

But if both players are rational and symmetric, they may converge on the **risk-dominant** or **payoff-dominant** equilibrium.

(A0, A0) is payoff-dominant (5,5), (A1, A1) is risk-dominant.

But since (A0, A0) gives higher payoff and both benefit, **if they can coordinate**, they will.

So a **reasonable assumption**: in the independent case, **both players will play A0** → get 5 each.

But if they were unsure, maybe not — but since there’s no information, and they are symmetric, assume they **coordinate on (A0, A0)**.

So if **neither delegates**, **both play A0**, you get 5.

---

So let’s summarize what happens under M2:

| Your Delegation | Other’s Delegation | Your Action | Other’s Action | Your Payoff |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Yes             | Yes                | A0          | A0             | 5            |
| Yes             | No                 | A1          | A1             | 3            |
| No              | Yes                | A1          | A1             | 3            |
| No              | No                 | A0          | A0             | 5            |

So your payoff depends on **both** of you.

Now, think: **will both players delegate?**

Let’s see if **delegation is a best response**.

**Suppose the other player will delegate.**

Then:
- If you delegate → you play A0, other plays A0 → you get 5
- If you don’t delegate → you can play A0 → then other plays A0 → you get 5

So **you are indifferent**: 5 either way.

So you’ll **might** delegate, or not — but no incentive to avoid it.

But: if you delegate, **you get 5**, same as not delegating.

But there’s **no additional cost**, so you might as well delegate.

But more importantly, if **both** are indifferent, but **coordinating on delegation** is possible.

But what if **only one** delegates?

Then the delegate **gets 3**, the non-delegate gets 3 (because both play A1, as shown)

But if both delegate, both get 5

So **both prefer both to delegate**, than only one or neither.

But if you think the other will delegate:

- If you delegate → get 5
- If you don’t → get 5

So you are indifferent — you can delegate or not.

But **if you delegate**, you can **get 5**, but **only if both delegate**.

But if you **don’t delegate**, and the other does, you get 3.

So if you **think the other will delegate**, you are better off **delegating** because then you get 5 vs 3.

Wait — let's re-check:

- If other delegates and you don't: you play A1 (since they play A1), get 3
- If you also delegate: both play A0 → you get 5

So **if you expect the other to delegate**, you **should delegate**, because 5 > 3

Similarly, if you expect the other to not delegate:

- If you delegate → you play A1 (only you delegate) → other plays A1 → you get 3
- If you don’t delegate → both play A0 → you get 5

So then you **should not delegate**

So:
- If others **delegate**, you should **delegate**
- If others **don’t delegate**, you should **not delegate**

This is a **best response pattern**.

So what are the equilibria?

1. **Both delegate**: yes, because if others delegate, you should as well → you get 5
2. **Both don’t delegate**: if others don’t delegate, you should not delegate (get 5 vs 3) → you get 5

But if both don’t delegate, you get 5.

But now, **is (both don’t delegate) a Nash equilibrium?**

Yes: if others don’t delegate, you shouldn’t delegate (because 5 > 3), so you don’t.

Similarly, if both delegate → you get 5, and if others do, you want to too.

So **two Nash equilibria**:
- Both delegate → get 5
- Both don’t delegate → get 5

In both, payoff is 5.

But now, is there a **focal point**?

- In both cases, you get 5
- But **delegation makes coordination easier** — if you delegate, you **ensure** you play A0 only if both delegate, but otherwise play A1.

But the equilibria are symmetric.

So **you can’t predict** which one will be played, unless there’s a **preference to delegate or not**.

But given symmetry, perhaps **both are possible**, but we might expect coordination on the **safe** choice.

But here’s the key: **under M2, the outcome can be either (A0,A0) or (A1,A1)**

- If both delegate → (A0,A0) → 5
- If both don’t delegate → (A0,A0) → 5
- If only one delegates → (A1,A1) → 3

So **only in the case of unequal delegation** do you get 3.

But in the symmetric equilibria (both delegate or both don’t), you get 5.

So **you can expect to get 5**, but **only if you coordinate on one of the symmetric equilibria**.

But if **you both try to deviate**, you might end up in (A1,A1) — but that’s only if one delegates and the other doesn’t.

But in equilibrium, you would avoid that.

So **assuming coordination on symmetric strategy**, M2 can lead to (A0,A0) with high probability.

So **your expected payoff under M2** is **5**, assuming you coordinate on both delegate or both don’t.

But wait — in the **independent case** (neither delegate), you get A0,A0 → 5

But if **you delegate**, and the other agrees, you get A0,A0 → 5

Same payoff.

But now: **what about the cost of delegation?** None mentioned. So no cost.

But **there is a risk** of **asymmetric delegation** leading to A1,A1 → 3.

But if you can coordinate, no issue.

So **M2 can lead to (A0,A0)**, but **with risk of (A1,A1)** if delegation asymmetry happens.

But **M1** always leads to A0,A0 — no risk.

Wait: under M1, **if you delegate**, you get A0.

But **if you don’t delegate**, you can still play A0.

And the other player, if rational, will play A0 if you play A0.

So again, you can get (A0,A0).

But now: **what if the other player deviates?**

But if the other player is rational, they won’t.

But under M1: **if you delegate**, you must play A0.

Then other will play A0 → you get 5.

If you don’t delegate, you can play A0 → other plays A0 → you get 5.

So you get 5 either way.

But **no risk of A1,A1**, because M1 always plays A0.

But in the **independent case** under M1: you can still **both play A0**, so you get 5.

But under M2, **only if no one delegates or both delegate**, you get 5; if one delegates, you get 3.

So M2 has **a risk** of accident.

But if both players are rational and coordinate, the risk is avoidable.

But here’s the real difference:

- M1: if you delegate, you **must** play A0 — no matter what the other does.
- M2: if you delegate, your action depends on **the other player**.

Now, here’s the **key insight**: **you are Player 1**, and you have a **mediator proposed by Player 1** (M1) and one by Player 2 (M2).

You want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

But also: **who controls the approval vote**?

But **you are voting now**, so **you can approve any subset**, and the other player will vote too.

But we don’t know what the other player will do.

But since you are optimizing, assume the **other player** will also act rationally to maximize their own payoff.

So **you must anticipate** what the other player will vote for.

But **your goal is to approve mediators to maximize your payoff**, so you must consider:

- If you approve both M1 and M2 → then both have approvals
- If they both get same number of approvals, then **one is chosen uniformly** at random

So if you approve M1 and M2, and the other player approves M1 only → then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins

But if the other player approves both → then both have 2 approvals → then **winner is chosen randomly**: 50% chance M1, 50% chance M2

So your expected payoff depends on that.

---

### **Step 6: Strategic Approval Choices**

Let’s suppose you **approve M1** and **not M2**

- Then M1 has at least 1 approval
- M2 has 0 → so M1 wins

So **M1 will be the mediator**, always.

Then, as above, in delegation stage, you can get 5.

Similarly, if you **approve M2** and not M1, then M2 wins → you can get 5 with coordination.

But **what if you approve both?**

Then:
- If the other player approves only M1 → M1 wins (2 vs 1) → M1 → you get 5
- If the other player approves only M2 → M2 wins → you get 5
- If the other player approves both → then both have 2 approvals → **winner chosen at random** → 50% M1, 50% M2

So in **only 50% of the time** you get M1, 50% M2

But with M1 or M2, in both cases, you can get 5 in equilibrium.

But under M2, there is **a risk** of getting 3, if delegation is asymmetric.

But under M1, **no risk**: you always get 5, regardless.

So **M1 is safer**.

Now, consider: **what if the other player is adversarial?**

But since they are rational, they will try to maximize *their* payoff.

So their choice of approval depends on what leads to better for them.

But **you don't know** what they will approve.

But you can **protect yourself**.

But here’s a better idea: **you want to maximize your **expected** payoff**, so you should **avoid mediators that give you risk**.

M1: **deterministic A0** for you → safe → always get 5 (if you act optimally)

M2: **only good if you coordinate**, but if you don't, you get 3

But **you can’t guarantee coordination**, especially if the other player is adversarial.

But more importantly: **under M2, if you delegate, you only get A0 if the other also delegates** — otherwise you get A1.

But **if you don’t delegate**, you can play A0 and get 5.

So **you have no incentive to delegate** under M2, because:
- If you delegate → you might get A1 (if other doesn’t), get 3
- If you don’t delegate → you can play A0 → get 5

So **you prefer not to delegate** under M2.

Similarly, the other player has same incentive.

So **if M2 is the mediator**, the **dominant strategy** is **don’t delegate** — because if you delegate and the other doesn’t, you get 3; if you don’t delegate, you can play A0 and get 5.

So **both players will choose not to delegate**.

Then — **both play A0**, so you get 5.

So **in equilibrium, both don’t delegate**, and you get 5.

But **if you both delegate**, you also get 5.

But **neither has incentive to deviate**, because:
- If you delegate, and other doesn’t, you get 3 — worse than 5
- So you won’t delegate

So **delegation is not attractive** under M2.

So **equilibrium is: neither delegates**

Then you play A0 — both get 5

So you get 5

Same as with M1.

But under M1:
- If you delegate → you play A0
- If you don’t — you can play A0 → get 5

So again, you can get 5

But **no risk**: you get 5 in both cases

Under M2, you **cannot get 5** unless both don’t delegate — but if one delegates, you get 3.

But if both know this, they **won’t delegate**, so you get 5

So in both cases, you can get 5

But is there a **difference**?

Yes: under **M2**, **you are forced to play A1 if only you delegate**.

But if you **never delegate**, you can avoid it.

Under **M1**, you are **forced to A0** if you delegate, but if you don’t, you can play A0.

So both **allow you to get 5**.

But M1 **is more predictable**.

But the real difference is in **what happens if the other player expects you to delegate**.

But let’s think about **if you approve both**.

Then:
- If you approve both, and the other approves only M1 → M1 wins → you get 5
- If other approves only M2 → M2 wins → you get 5
- If both approve both → 50% M1, 50% M2 → you get 5 in both cases

So no matter what, you **get 5**

Similarly, if you approve only M1 → M1 wins → you get 5

If you approve only M2 → M2 wins → you get 5

So **in all cases, you can get 5**

So **any approval set** leads to 5?

But not quite.

Wait: what if **only M2 is approved by everyone**, and **you approve it**.

Then M2 is the winner.

Then, as above, equilibrium is **neither delegates**, you play A0, get 5.

But what if **under M2**, **both delegate**?

Then you get 5 also.

But the equilibrium is **neither delegates**, because if you delegate and other doesn’t, you get 3 < 5.

So **no incentive to delegate**.

But **you can still get 5**

So yes, you can get 5.

But now, **is there any disadvantage?**

Here’s a **key insight**: **if you delegate under M2, you might be worse off**.

But **since you can choose not to delegate**, you can avoid that.

So **no harm**.

But consider: **M1 forces A0**, but M2 is **riskier** only if you delegate.

But you can avoid delegation.

So both are safe.

But now, here’s the **crucial asymmetry**:

- M1 is proposed by **you**, Player 1
- M2 is proposed by **Player 2**

Player 2 proposed M2.

Player 2 wants to maximize their payoff.

Under M2:

- If only one delegates → M2 plays A1

So if **Player 2 delegates alone**, they play A1

Then you (Player 1) will play A1 (best response), and Player 2 gets 3

But if **both delegate**, they get A0 → 5

So **Player 2 has incentive to try to get both to delegate**, but if they delegate and you don’t, they get 3.

But they know.

But if they **don’t delegate**, they can play A0.

So **Player 2’s dominant strategy is also not to delegate under M2**, if they expect you not to.

But if they expect you to delegate, they might want to also.

But again, if you delegate and they don’t, they get 3, if they don’t delegate, they can get 5.

So again, **Player 2 will not delegate** under M2.

So both players not delegate → both play A0 → Player 2 gets 5

Same as you.

But now, **what if you approve M1**?

Then M1 wins.

M1 always plays A0, so you play A0 if you delegate.

But you can play A0 anyway.

So no difference.

But here’s the **real opportunity**:

- If **you approve M1 only**, then M1 wins
- You can delegate or not — doesn’t matter
- But competitive advantage?

No.

But suppose you approve **both**, and the other player approves only M2.

Then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 1 → M1 wins.

Then you can get 5.

But if you approve only M2, and the other approves only M2, M2 wins → you can get 5.

But **M1 is safer** in the sense that it **forces coordination**.

But let’s think about **what happens if the other player wants to exploit**.

But both players are symmetric in this game.

But here’s the **critical point**:

- M1 **always plays A0**, regardless
- M2 **plays A0 only if both delegate**

But if you **approve M1**, then M1 wins (if endorsed by you), and you can **time your action**.

But no.

Actually, **the only benefit** of a mediator is if it helps you **coordinate or commit**.

But here, under M1, you **don’t need to rely** on commitment — you can just play A0.

So **M1 does nothing new**.

But under M2, if **both players decide to delegate**, both get A0.

But they have **no incentive to**.

But suppose you **want to encourage delegation**.

But you can’t.

But wait: if you **approve M2**, then **M2 is available**, but it’s **proposed by Player 2**, who might not want it.

But here’s a better idea: **if you approve M1, you increase its chance of winning**.

But M1 is safe.

But the **real difference** is in **what the other player will do**.

- If you approve M1, and they dislike you, they might approve only M2 → then M1 wins (if you approve it)
- If you don’t approve M1, and they approve only M2, then M2 wins

But you want to ensure you can get 5.

But you can.

But here’s the **only catch**:

- Under M1, if you delegate, you play A0
- Under M2, if you delegate, you play A1 if only you delegate

But since you can choose not to delegate, no problem.

But if you **approve only M2**, then M2 might win.

Then you are at risk if the other delegates.

But again, the other won't, so you are fine.

But **M1 is more likely to be selected if you approve it**, and it is safer.

But in expectation, you get 5 in all cases.

But let’s look back at the **payoff table**:

- If you play A0 and other plays A0: 5
- You play A0 and other A1: 0
- You play A1 and other A0: 3
- A1 and A1: 3

So (A0,A0) is best.

But the only way to get 0 or 3 is if one plays A0 and other A1.

So to avoid that, you need alignment.

But with M1, you can **ensure** that if you delegate, you play A0.

With M2, you can only ensure A0 if both delegate, which doesn't happen.

So M1 is better for **commitment**.

But since you can play A0 anyway, it's not needed.

But here is the **best strategy**:

- You should **approve M1** because it is safer.
- M1 always plays A0, so it’s like a **commitment to A0**.
- Even if you don't delegate, you can still play A0.

But if you **approve M2**, it’s riskier because if you delegate and the other doesn't, you get A1 and the other gets A1 or A0, but you get 3.

So you have a risk of 3 if delegation is asymmetric.

But you can avoid delegation.

So no harm.

But to **maximize safety**, approve M1.

Also, since it's **proposed by you**, it's more likely to be supported.

But you are asked to choose approvals.

Final decision:

- M1: safe, always gives you A0 if you delegate, but you can play A0 anyway.
- M2: has risk of worse outcome if delegation unbalanced.

But in equilibrium, you avoid delegation, so both are fine.

But here’s a **reason to approve M1**:

- If you approve M1, then M1 is available, and you can use it.
- If you don't approve M1, then M2 might win, and you might get 3 in some cases, but in equilibrium you don't.

After careful analysis, both mediators allow you to achieve 5.

But **M1 is simpler and safer**.

Moreover, **if both players approve M2**, and it wins, but one of them delegates, both get 3.

But we said the equilibrium is no delegation.

But **is it stable?**

Yes.

But **no real advantage**.

But there’s one thing: **if you approve both, you force the winner to be chosen between them**, but the other player might not want that.

If you approve only M1, then M1 wins with certainty.

If you approve only M2, then M2 wins.

But if you approve both, and the other approves both, then random choice.

But in that case, you still get 5.

But since you are player 1, and you want control, you should **approve M1 to ensure it has a chance**.

But the best move is to **approve M1**, because:
- It's safe
- It's the only one that guarantees A0 in all scenarios, even if you delegate
- M2 has a conditional behavior that might be exploited, but not in equilibrium

So overall, **approve M1**.

Now, should you approve M2?

If you approve M2, you reduce its chance of being selected, but if you don’t approve it, it might win.

But since you want to maximize your payoff, and both mediators give you 5 in equilibrium, it's fine.

But to **avoid the risk of M2** winning and potentially requiring coordination, it’s better to **not approve M2**.

But you can’t prevent it.

The safest is to **approve only M1**.

Then M1 is guaranteed to win (if you approve it, and the other doesn’t approve M1, but if you approve it, and they don’t, M1 wins; if they do, still M1 wins if you do).

But if you approve only M1, and the other approves only M2, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1, so both have max approval (1), so winner chosen at random.

So there's a 50% chance M1 wins, 50% M2.

If M1 wins, you get 5.

If M2 wins, you get 5.

So still get 5.

Similarly, if you approve both, and other approves only M1, then M1 has 2, M2 has 1 -> M1 wins.

If other approves both, then 2 each -> random.

In all cases, you get 5.

So no difference.

But to be safe from any risk, the only way is to have a single mediator who is safe.

But M2 has no risk in equilibrium.

So you can approve both.

But the question is: **which ones you approve**.

Since you are to **maximize your expected points**, and all choices lead to 5 in equilibrium, but **M1 is simpler**, and since it's proposed by you, you should approve it.

But to **ensure you have a safe option**, approve M1.

Approval of M2 is not harmful.

But let’s look at the expected value.

- If you approve M1 and not M2: then M1 wins unless other approves M2 and you don't -> but you do approve it? No, you don't approve M2.

If you approve M1 only, and other approves M2 only, then both have 1 validation -> winner random -> 50% M1, 50% M2 -> you get 5 always.

Similarly, if you approve both, same.

So you can approve both.

But there is no benefit to approving M2, because you can't improve your payoff.

In fact, by approving M2, you give it a chance to be selected, and if it is selected, and if there is an accident (one delegates), you get 3.

But in equilibrium, no one delegates, so you get 5.

But the only way you get 3 is if you delegate and the other doesn't.

But you won't, so no.

So safe.

But you can approve both.

The safe and optimal is to approve **M1**, and possibly M2.

But the only way to guarantee safety is to have M1 win.

So to **maximize the chance of M1 winning**, approve M1.

Approving M2 does not help.

But it doesn't hurt.

However, since M2 is proposed by Player 2, who might be adversarial, you might not want to give it support.

But in choice, it's optional.

After all, the expected payoff is the same.

But to be safe and avoid any risk, approve only M1.

But even if you approve only M1, you get 5.

So it's fine.

Therefore, the decision is to **approve M1**, and **not approve M2**.

Why not approve M2? Because if you approve it, and it wins, and the other player is adversarial, but still, you can get 5.

No benefit.

But no harm.

But since you want to maximize, and there's no difference, you can approve.

But let’s see the score.

Actually, if you approve M2, you are giving it license to be chosen, which might be bad.

But since you can win anyway, it's neutral.

But to prevent M2 from winning, you should not approve it.

So to **maximize the chance of M1 winning**, you should approve M1 and not approve M2.

Then, if the other player approves only M1, M1 wins.
If the other approves M2, then M1 has 1, M2 has 1 -> random -> 50% M1, 50% M2 -> you still get 5.

So your expected payoff is 5.

If you approve both, same thing.

But by not approving M2, you **prevent it from winning** only if the other doesn't approve it.

But if the other does, it's still 50/50.

So no gain.

But you might as well approve M1.

I think the answer is to approve M1 and not M2.

So:

{"M1": true, "M2": false}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.


Instruction:

- Output must contain a valid JSON object at the end.
- Keys must be the action names exactly as given.
- Values must be percentage points given in integers.
- The values must sum to exactly 100.

response:
Looking at this step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the base game payoffs (my perspective as Player 1)
```
           Other: A0    Other: A1
Me: A0        5            0
Me: A1        3            3
```

Key observation: A1 guarantees me 3 points, while A0 is risky (5 vs 0).

## Step 2: Analyze the mediator mechanism
- If 1 player delegates → mediator plays A1
- If 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0

## Step 3: Calculate payoffs with delegation option (A2)

If I delegate (A2):
- Other plays A0 or A1: Only I delegate → mediator plays A1 for me → I get 3
- Other delegates (A2): Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → I get 5

Expanded payoff matrix:
```
           Other: A0    Other: A1    Other: A2
Me: A0        5            0            0
Me: A1        3            3            3
Me: A2        3            3            5
```

## Step 4: Identify Nash equilibria

**Pure strategy equilibrium (A2, A2):**
- If other delegates, my best response is to delegate (5 > 3)
- If I delegate, other's best response is to delegate (symmetric game)
- Outcome: Both get 5 points ✓

**Mixed strategy equilibrium (60% A0, 40% A1):**
- Exists but gives only 3 points expected value
- Doesn't utilize the mediator

## Step 5: Strategic reasoning

The mediator was proposed by Player 2, suggesting they intend to use it. The mechanism is designed to:
1. Encourage coordination (mutual delegation gives best outcome)
2. Provide safety (delegating alone still gives 3, same as A1)
3. Achieve the cooperative outcome (A0, A0) → 5 points each

Delegation strictly dominates other strategies when the opponent is rational:
- Against A0: Delegation gives 3 (better than A0's 0)
- Against A1: Delegation gives 3 (equal to A1)
- Against A2: Delegation gives 5 (best outcome)

## Conclusion

Pure delegation maximizes my expected payoff given rational play.

```json
{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which mediators you, as **Player 2**, should approve.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without mediation)**

The game is a symmetric coordination game with the following payoff matrix (Player 1 is rows, Player 2 is columns — but you are **Player 2**, so your payoffs are the second number in each pair):

|               | Player 1: A0 | Player 1: A1 |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| **You (P2): A0** | (5, 5)       | (0, 3)       |
| **You (P2): A1** | (3, 0)       | (3, 3)       |

Let’s analyze the pure strategy Nash equilibria:

- (A0, A0): Both get 5 → better than (A1, A0) or (A0, A1), so this is a strong equilibrium.
- (A1, A1): Both get 3 → not as good as (A0,A0), but neither player wants to deviate unilaterally: if you're playing A1 and opponent plays A1, you get 3, but deviating to A0 gives you 0 → so stable.
- (A0, A1): You get 0, opponent gets 3 → you want to deviate to A1 → not stable.
- (A1, A0): You get 3, opponent gets 0 → opponent wants to deviate to A1 → not stable.

So the pure Nash equilibria are:
- (A0, A0): 5 points each
- (A1, A1): 3 points each

But there’s no dominant strategy. This is similar to a **coordination game**, where players want to coordinate on the same action. (A0, A0) is Pareto superior.

However, since you’re playing from the perspective of **Player 2**, and no communication is allowed (only voting on the mediator), you need to reason about the long-term outcome based on delegation and mediator behavior.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the delegation mechanism**

You have two choices:
1. **Act independently**: choose a probability over A0 and A1.
2. **Delegate** to a mediator: your move is chosen by the mediator based on the number of players who delegate to it.

Before playing the game, **you and the other player will vote on mediators** using **approval voting**, and the **winning mediator** is selected uniformly at random from those with the most approvals.

You are to **approve some mediators and reject others**. The vote happens **before** the game, and you can’t change your mind.

Then, **if you delegate**, the mediator behaves based on how many players have delegated to it (1 or 2).

Note: **Mediators only act if someone delegates to them.**

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the proposed mediators**

We have two mediators:

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1):**
- If **1 player** delegates to it → plays **A0**
- If **2 players** delegate to it → plays **A0**

So, regardless of whether 1 or 2 people delegate to M1, it **always plays A0**.

→ So M1 is **A0-solely**.

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2):**
- If **1 player** delegates to it → plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate to it → plays **A0**

So:
- If only you or only the other player delegates to M2 → it plays A1
- If both delegate → it plays A0

So M2’s behavior depends on the number of delegates.

---

### **Step 4: What is your incentive as Player 2?**

You want to **maximize your expected points**.

But you don’t know what the other player will do — they could vote, and may delegate differently.

But you do know that **you are choosing voting behavior**, and the outcome depends on:
- How many players approve each mediator (to determine which mediators are in the running).
- Whether you decide to delegate or not.
- The other player’s decisions (which you must anticipate strategically).

But remember: **The winning mediator is selected at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.**

So if you approve M1 and M2, but the other player only approves M1, then M1 wins (more approvals).  
If you and the other player both approve M1 and M2, then both have 2 approvals, so one is picked uniformly at random.

But here’s a key twist: **You don’t get to pick the mediator — you can only approve or disapprove.**

So you must decide: for each mediator, **do you want it to have a chance of being selected?**

But you also have to decide **whether to delegate** — which depends on what mediator you believe will be selected.

So this becomes a **meta-game**: you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, factoring in:
- The chance that a certain mediator wins,
- Your strategy (delegate or not),
- The other player’s likely behavior.

But since you don’t know what the other player will do, you must assume rational behavior and anticipate their incentives.

---

### **Step 5: What does the other player want?**

The other player is **Player 1**, and they proposed **M1**.

So they have a **strong incentive** to get **M1 approved** — because M1 plays A0 no matter what. That benefits both players when both choose A0.

But if M1 is selected, and you (Player 2) delegate to it, you’ll play A0.

Similarly, if they delegate to M1, they play A0.

So **Player 1 wants M1 to be selected**, and prefers **you to delegate** so that they can coordinate on A0.

Now, **M2** is proposed by **Player 2** (i.e., you). So you have a personal interest in getting **M2** approved.

But you must decide whether to **approve both** or only one.

Let’s think about what happens **if M1 is selected**:
- Regardless of how many delegate, it plays A0.
- If **you delegate**, you get A0.
- If you don’t, you choose your own action.

Similarly, **if M2 is selected**:
- If only one person delegates, M2 plays A1.
- If both delegate, M2 plays A0.

So if both delegate to M2, you both play A0 → you get 5 each → **best possible outcome**.

If **only you delegate** to M2, you get A1, and the other player plays **whatever they do** — if they are independent, they might play A0 or A1.

But if **only the other player delegates**, then M2 plays A1, and you (if independent) could play A0 or A1.

So outcomes depend heavily on delegation.

---

### **Step 6: Your goal: Maximize your expected payoff**

You are **Player 2**.

Let’s consider the two mediators from your perspective.

#### Option A: Approve only M1
- You vote for M1.
- Player 1 (who proposed M1) will likely vote for M1.
- If you **only approve M1**, and Player 1 approves M1, then M1 has 2 approvals, M2 has 0 → M1 wins.
- So the mediator is M1 → always plays A0 regardless.

Now, **do you delegate?**
- If you delegate to M1 → you play A0.
- If you don’t delegate → you choose your action.

But now, Player 1 is playing A0 (if they delegate) or possibly A0 or A1.

But if Player 1 delegates → they play A0.

If they don’t delegate → they choose their own action.

So if M1 is active and you delegate → you play A0.

If you don’t delegate → you can choose to play A0 or A1.

But if you play A0, and they play A0 → you both get 5 → best.

If you play A1, and they play A0 → you get 3, they get 0.

But if the **other player** is rational (and they want to maximize their payoff), and they see you are not delegating, they might ask: "Should I delegate?"

Let’s suppose **both** players are rational and want to maximize their own payoff.

But since **you are choosing the approval**, and the other player is also rational, we can **assume mutual anticipation**.

But here’s the key insight:

#### **If M1 is selected**: it plays A0 no matter what.

So **if you delegate**, you play A0.

**If you don’t delegate**, you can choose, but if you choose A0, you get 5 if the other plays A0.

But if you choose A1, you get 3 if they play A0.

So in any case, if you don’t delegate and they play A0, you can only get 5 (by choosing A0) or 3 (by choosing A1).

So rational you will choose A0.

Similarly, rational Player 1 will choose A0 (since it’s best when the other plays A0).

So if **both play A0**, you get 5.

So if M1 is selected, **both players can coordinate on A0**, and get 5 each.

So **if M1 is selected, and you delegate, you get A0 → you can get 5**.

But even if you don’t delegate, you’ll still choose A0 → same result.

So **M1 leads to a safe 5** if both choose A0.

But can we do better?

---

#### **What if M2 is selected?**

Let’s suppose M2 is selected (i.e., both you and Player 1 approve it, so it’s tied or has max approvals).

Now, if **both** of you delegate to M2 → M2 plays A0 → you both get 5.

Perfect.

But if only **one** of you delegates, M2 plays A1.

So if you delegate and they don’t → you play A1.

They then choose their own action.

If they choose A0 → you get 0 (since you are A1, they are A0) → bad.

If they choose A1 → you both get 3.

But **they** will want to maximize their payoff.

So if you delegate to M2 → you play A1.

Now, if the other player **does not delegate**, they can choose their action.

They will choose:
- If they play A0 → they get 3 (since you are A1) → so 3.
- If they play A1 → they get 3 (you A1) → so 3.

So they are indifferent → they might choose A0 or A1.

But **they prefer A0**, because it gives them 3 regardless? Wait, no:

- If you are A1, and they pick A0 → they get **3**
- If they pick A1 → they get **3**

So same payoff.

But if they pick A0, it's better for you (you get 0 vs 3) — so they are **indifferent**.

But we can assume they randomize, or choose A0 arbitrarily.

But **you get 0 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1**.

So your expected payoff if you delegate to M2 and they don’t: **between 0 and 3**, depending on their choice.

They might play A0 for symmetry? Or A1?

But since they are rational and you’re taking over their action via delegation, they might prefer not to delegate to avoid giving you the power to force A1.

But **you are the one who damages the outcome** by choosing A1 under M2 when only one delegates.

So **M2 is risky when only one delegates**.

But **if both delegate**, M2 plays A0 → you both get 5 — **best possible**.

So **you want both to delegate to M2** to get 5.

But **Player 1** wants M1 → always A0.

So **Player 1 is not incentivized to delegate to M2**, unless they think they can get better than 5.

But **M2 is only beneficial for them if both delegate**, because then they get A0 — same as before.

But if **only they delegate**, they play A1, and you play whatever.

If you play A0 → they get 0 → worse than 5.

If you play A1 → they get 3 — still worse than 5.

So **Player 1 prefers not to delegate to M2** unless they are sure you will delegate too.

But **if only one delegates**, they get 3 at best, 0 at worst — so **they are worse off**.

So **Player 1 will not delegate to M2 unless they are confident you will too**.

But you can’t ensure that.

So **Player 1 has no incentive to delegate to M2**.

Therefore, it’s very unlikely that **both delegate to M2**.

Thus, **M2 will almost surely result in only one delegate** (either you or them), or neither.

But if **only you delegate to M2**, then:
- You play A1.
- Player 1 chooses their action (independent).
- They are rational, so they will choose A0 or A1?

As above, if you are A1, and they choose A0 → they get 3.
If they choose A1 → they get 3.

So indifferent.

But they might choose A0 (because it’s symmetric), or A1.

But **if they choose A0**, you get 0.

If they choose A1, you get 3.

So **your expected payoff if you delegate alone to M2** is between 0 and 3 → **at most 3**.

Whereas if you delegate to M1, you get A0 → then if they play A0 (which they will), you get 5.

Even if you don’t delegate, and you play A0 → you get 5.

So M1 gives you **5** for sure.

But M2, if only you delegate → gives you somewhere between 0 and 3.

And if only they delegate → they play A1 (since only one delegate), you get to choose.

You can play A0 → you get 0 (they A1), or A1 → you get 3.

So if they delegate to M2 → they play A1, you can play A1 → get 3.

But if you play A0 → you get 0.

So you will play A1 → get 3.

So if **they delegate**, and you don’t → you get 3.

But again: **Player 1 has no reason to delegate to M2**, because:
- If they delegate alone → they play A1 → they get 3 if you play A1, 0 if you play A0.
- They can’t control you.

So they expect you to play A1 (if you’re rational), so they get 3.

But if they **don’t delegate**, and they play A0, and you play A0 → they get 5.

So **they prefer not to delegate to M2** — because it can only make them worse off (from 5 to 3).

So **Player 1 will never delegate to M2**, regardless.

Therefore, **it is impossible for both to delegate to M2**, because **Player 1 will not**.

So **M2 will only be used if you delegate to it**, and Player 1 does not.

Then:
- You choose A1 (via M2).
- Player 1 plays A0 (rational, since that gives them 3, same as A1, but maybe they prefer clean behavior).
- Then you get **0**.

So you get **0**.

You could try to play A0 if you don’t delegate, but then why delegate?

Alternatively, if you **don’t delegate**, and they don’t either — then both choose independently.

But rational players: they might choose A0 to get 5.

But if they are in doubt, they might play A1 — but (A1,A1) gives 3 to both.

But (A0,A0) gives 5 — better.

So rational players will aim for (A0,A0).

But **since you can coordinate via M1**, which forces A0, M1 is **safe**.

Whereas M2 is dangerous — if you delegate alone, you get 0.

And you can’t force Player 1 to delegate to M2.

So **M2 is worse for you** than M1.

Therefore, **you should not approve M2** — because:
- It gives you only a chance to get 0 or 3.
- It’s not worth risking being punished by Player 1 choosing A0 and you playing A1.

Even if you approved M2, it would **only win if both approve it**, but **Player 1 has no incentive to approve M2**, because it:
- Gives them 3 worst-case (if only they delegate), but 5 if they don’t delegate to it.
- So **they will not approve M2**.

Therefore, **M2 will never win**, because Player 1 will not approve it.

So **even if you approve M2**, it will not be selected.

Meanwhile, **if you approve M1**, and Player 1 approves M1, M1 wins.

And M1 gives you 5 for sure (by delegating or not).

So **M1 is safe**, **M2 is not viable**.

Therefore, you should:
- **Approve M1** → it gives you a reliable 5
- **Disapprove M2** → it’s not going to win, and carries risk

---

### **Final Decision**

You are **Player 2**, and you want to maximize your points.

- **Approve M1**: Yes — it leads to A0, and if used (which it will be), you get 5 with certainty.
- **Approve M2**: No — Player 1 will not approve it, so it won’t be selected. Even if it were, it’s risky and likely leads to 0.

Also, note: **You are the proposer of M2**, so you might be tempted to approve it for strategic reasons, but **strategic rationality** says: **only approve what has a chance of benefiting you**.

Since M2 cannot win (due to Player 1’s incentive), you **should not approve it**.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's carefully analyze this decision-making game step by step, including the twist involving delegation to a mediator.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

This is a symmetric game between two players, where each chooses A0 or A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff, Player 2’s payoff) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | (5,5)    | (0,3)    |
| **A1**               | (3,0)    | (3,3)    |

This is similar to a coordination game with a conflict of interest in terms of coordination.

We are to find a Nash equilibrium, or at least the best response strategy for **Player 1**, considering that **we can delegate to a mediator**.

But now comes the twist.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You (Player 1) have a third action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

The mediator’s behavior:
- If **1 player** delegates → the mediator plays **A0**
- If **2 players** delegate → the mediator plays **A0**

So, regardless of how many players delegate (1 or 2), the mediator plays **A0**.

Important notes:
- If **only you delegate**, the mediator plays A0 → you get whatever payoff you would get if you played A0 and the other player plays their chosen action.
- If **both you and the other player delegate**, then the mediator plays A0 for both → so both players get the outcome where both played A0 → (5,5)
- If **neither delegates**, then both players choose A0 or A1 independently (via their own strategies).

Now, the key is: **You cannot control whether the other player delegates**. But you can choose your strategy (probabilities over A0, A1, A2).

Also, the mediator is **not a player**, but an automated mechanism. The other player may or may not delegate.

Let’s assume both players act rationally to maximize their own expected payoff.

We are Player 1, and our goal is to **maximize our own expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze What Happens in Each Case**

Let’s consider the possible scenarios based on **how many players delegate**.

#### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), other player does NOT delegate**

- Mediator plays A0 for you.
- Other player chooses A0 or A1 with their own mixed strategy (we will treat this as variable for now).

Let’s denote:
- Let \( q \) = probability other player chooses A0
- Then \( 1 - q \) = probability other player chooses A1

Then your expected payoff in this case is:
- If other plays A0: you get 5 (since mediator plays A0, other plays A0)
- If other plays A1: you get 0 (mediator plays A0, other plays A1)

So your expected payoff:  
\( 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q \)

But note: **The other player is also trying to maximize their payoff.** So they will choose a strategy (q) based on what they expect you to do.

We need to model the **simultaneous choice** of actions including delegation.

So this is a **game with strategic delegation** — you’re choosing a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2; the other player does the same.

Let’s define:
- Let \( p_0 \) = your probability of playing A0
- Let \( p_1 \) = your probability of playing A1
- Let \( p_2 \) = your probability of playing A2 (delegate)

Then: \( p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 \)

Similarly, let \( q_0, q_1, q_2 \) be the other player's probabilities.

---

### **Step 4: Strategy When You Delegate (A2)**

As established:
- If you delegate, mediator plays A0 regardless of how many delegate.
- So your action becomes **A0**, no matter what.

So if you choose A2, your effective action is A0.

Similarly, if the other player chooses A2 (delegate), their effective action is A0.

Important: **Delegation makes you play A0 deterministically.**

So the outcome depends on:
- How many players delegate: 0, 1, or 2
- What each player plays if they don’t delegate

---

### **Step 5: Compute Expected Payoffs for You Under Different Scenarios**

Let’s compute your expected payoff as a function of your strategy \( (p_0, p_1, p_2) \) and the opponent’s strategy \( (q_0, q_1, q_2) \), but since the opponent is rational, we will assume they play a best response. In symmetric games, we may look for **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

But note: the mediator’s behavior is asymmetric — both players are "tied" to A0 if they delegate, but the other player may also delegate.

Let’s suppose **both players are rational and symmetric**. Then it is reasonable to assume that in equilibrium, both players use the same strategy.

Let’s assume that both play the same mixed strategy:  
\( p_0 = a \), \( p_1 = b \), \( p_2 = c \), with \( a + b + c = 100 \)

We’ll now try to find a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

But since you are Player 1, and the other player is similar, we can compute your best response to their strategy.

Alternatively, since the mediator always plays A0 when used, let's see: **Is delegation ever beneficial?**

Let’s evaluate options.

---

### **Step 6: Compare Payoffs from Strategies**

Let’s evaluate the possible equilibria.

#### **Option 1: No one delegates — both play A0 or A1**

If no one delegates, we are back to the original game.

Original symmetric game:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

Symmetric Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies?

Let’s find the mixed NE.

Let each player play A0 with probability \( x \), A1 with probability \( 1 - x \)

Player 1’s expected payoff from playing A0:
- If opponent plays A0: 5
- If opponent plays A1: 0
→ Expected: \( 5x + 0(1 - x) = 5x \)

Player 1’s expected payoff from playing A1:
- If opponent plays A0: 3
- If opponent plays A1: 3
→ Expected: \( 3x + 3(1 - x) = 3 \)

In mixed strategy equilibrium, both actions must give same payoff.

So set:  
\( 5x = 3 \) → \( x = 3/5 = 60\% \)

So in symmetric mixed strategy NE: each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

Expected payoff: 3 (from A1) or 5×0.6 = 3 → yes.

So **without delegation**, symmetric equilibrium gives each player 3 points.

Let’s call this **Equilibrium A**: no delegation, play A0 60%, A1 40%, A2 0%

Expected payoff: 3

Now — can we do better with delegation?

---

### **Step 7: What if You Delegate to Mediator (A2)?**

Suppose you delegate: \( p_2 = 100 \), so you play A2.

Now, what is the other player’s best response?

Let’s suppose you **always delegate** (i.e., \( p_2 = 100 \), \( p_0 = p_1 = 0 \))

Then:
- You play A0 (via mediator)
- The other player chooses their best strategy against this.

Let’s suppose the other player considers: should they delegate, or play A0/A1?

Let’s compute their best response.

If **other player delegates** (i.e., plays A2), then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → outcome: (5,5) → other player gets 5

If **other player plays A0**:
- You play A0 (via mediator)
- Other plays A0
→ outcome: (5,5) → other gets 5

If **other player plays A1**:
- You play A0
- Other plays A1
→ outcome: (0,3) → other gets 3

So for the other player:
- If they delegate: get 5
- If they play A0: get 5
- If they play A1: get 3

So best responses: play A2 or A0 → both give 5

So they are indifferent between A0 and A2.

So they could play A0 or A2 or a mixture.

But if they are **rational**, and **maximize payoff**, they will not play A1 — they will choose a mix of A0 and A2.

So if you delegate (A2), the other player will **never play A1**, because it gives only 3, while A0 or A2 gives 5.

So their best response is to play A0 or A2 — both give 5.

Now, what if they play A2?

- Then both delegate: outcome (A0, A0) → (5,5)
- Your payoff: 5

What if they play A0?
- You play A0, they play A0 → (5,5) → your payoff: 5

So **no matter** what they do (as long as they don’t pick A1), your payoff is 5.

So **if you delegate, you’ll get 5 points**, regardless of the other player’s action (as long as they don't play A1, which they won’t, since it's not optimal).

Why? Because they can get 5 by playing A0 or A2, but only 3 by playing A1.

So they will **not** play A1.

Thus, **if you delegate, you get 5 points for sure.**

This is **better than the 3** from the symmetric Nash equilibrium.

So **delegation is strictly better than the pure mixed strategy NE!**

But wait — is that sustainable?

Suppose **both** players can delegate.

If you delegate, other player gets 5 by delegating or playing A0.

Similarly, if the other player delegates, you also get 5.

So what if **both delegate**?

- Then both play A0 via mediator → (5,5) → both get 5.

But if you delegate, and the other player **delegates**, you both get 5.

If you delegate and the other plays A0, you both get 5.

So your payoff is always 5 if you delegate.

Can you do better than 5?

Is 5 the maximum possible?

Check the payoff matrix:
- Maximum payoff is 5 (from A0,A0)

So **5 is the maximum possible for any player**.

Therefore, **if you can secure a 5**, you are doing as well as possible.

So **delegating gives you a guaranteed 5**, regardless of what the other player does (as long as they don’t play A1, which they won’t, since they get 5 from A0 or A2).

But — what if the other player **deviates** and plays A1?

Then you get 0.

But if the other player plays A1, they get only 3, while they could get 5 by playing A0 or A2.

So **if they are rational**, they will not play A1 — they have **no incentive** to.

Therefore, **you can safely delegate**, knowing that the other player will either play A0 or A2 (both give them 5), and thus **you will get 5**.

So delegation gives you **certain payoff of 5**.

This beats the 3 from the symmetric mixed NE.

Now — is there a reason **not** to delegate?

Let’s suppose **both players** think this way.

Suppose you play A2 with probability 100.

Then other player’s best response: play A2 or A0 (both give 5), not A1.

So they are happy to play A2 or A0.

Thus, you get 5.

But can you do better than 5? **No**, since 5 is maximum.

So **maximizing your payoff** leads to **getting 5**, which is achieved by **delegating**.

But wait — is there a risk?

Only if the other player plays A1.

But they won’t, because it gives them only 3.

So **delegation is a dominant strategy?** Not quite, but it's **strictly better than other options, as long as the other player is rational.**

But let’s check: suppose you try to play A0.

What happens?

Your payoff depends on the other player.

If they play A0: you get 5

If they play A1: you get 0

If they play A2: they play A0 → you get 5

So if they play A0 or A2 → you get 5

If they play A1 → you get 0

But they will not play A1, because they get 3, while they could get 5.

So if you play A0, and they are rational, they will play A0 or A2 → you get 5

So **same outcome**.

Similarly, if you play A1:

- If other plays A0: you get 3
- If other plays A1: you get 3
- If other plays A2: you play A1, they play A0 → (3,0) → you get 3

So no matter what, if you play A1, you get only 3.

So **A1 is dominated**.

So among pure strategies:
- A0: you get 5 (if other is rational)
- A1: you get 3 (always)
- A2: you get 5 (if other is rational)

So **both A0 and A2 give 5** when the other player is rational.

But now: is there a **difference**?

Yes.

**If you play A0**, the other player sees that you played A0.

They are indifferent between playing A0, A2, or A1 — but A1 gives them less, so they won’t.

But if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

But they won’t play A1.

So you still get 5.

Same as if you delegate.

But delegation is **more robust** in some sense — but in this case, it doesn’t matter.

But wait — **can you coordinate better?**

But here’s a subtle point: **the mediator is controlled by Player 1**.

But in this setup, **the mediator is selected by approval voting**, but we are told it was proposed by Player 1 and selected.

But importantly: **the mediator will play A0 if 1 or 2 players delegate.**

So **your delegation forces you to play A0**.

But if you play A0 directly, same thing.

So **why delegate?**

Because delegation gives you **commitment** to A0, which might help if you could influence the other player.

But in this game, the other player has no incentive to play A1 anyway.

But suppose the other player is **not rational**, or **does not understand**.

Then **delegation might be safer** — because even if they mis-coordinate, you are still on A0.

But the problem assumes both players are rational and aim to maximize points.

So under full rationality, playing A0 or A2 both give 5.

But let’s go back to **the mixed strategy**.

Suppose you play a mixed strategy.

Can you mix A0 and A2?

But both give 5 when the other player plays optimally.

But the **key point** is this:

If you **delegated**, and the other player **also delegates**, outcome is (5,5)

If you play A0, and they play A0, outcome is (5,5)

Same.

But here’s a **crucial insight**: the **mediator's behavior is fixed**.

It always plays A0, even if only one delegates.

So delegation has **no risk**.

But playing A0 directly has the **same outcome** in equilibrium — because the other player will not play A1.

So both A0 and A2 give 5.

But what if the **other player** considers: “should I delegate?”

If you do not delegate, and you play A0 with high probability, they may still want to play A0 or A2.

But the **only way** to get higher than 5 is impossible.

But wait: **is there a way to get more than 5?** No — maximum is 5.

So 5 is best.

Now, can we game this further?

Suppose you **always delegate** → you get 5.

Suppose you play A0 → you get 5.

But **if you play A0 and the other player is irrational**, they might play A1 → you get 0.

But delegation **protects** you from that: you are forced to play A0, and **the mediator has no choice**.

But under rationality, the other player never plays A1.

So disparity disappears.

But in **equilibrium**, we must assume mutual rationality.

So in symmetric rational play, both players would be happy to get 5.

But here’s a better idea: **what if both players delegate?**

Then outcome is (5,5) — good.

But if both players are rational and know this, then **both prefer to delegate**, because it gives 5.

And since delegation gives 5 regardless, and it’s safe, and better than A1.

So **in symmetric equilibrium**, it is tempting to **both delegate**.

But can we make a symmetric equilibrium where both play **A2 with 100%**?

Let’s test it.

**Test strategy: Play A2 with 100%**

Then:
- You play A0 (via mediator)
- Opponent sees you delegate, so they know you play A0.

Opponent’s choices:
- Play A0: get 5
- Play A1: get 3
- Play A2: get 5

So best responses: A0 or A2 → both give 5.

So they are happy to play A2.

So if they play A2, both delegate → outcome (5,5)

So it is a **best response** for them to play A2.

Therefore: **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Mediator)**

We are in a two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**:

- **Mutual A0** gives highest payoff (5,5) — best for both.
- **A0 vs A1**: You get 0, opponent gets 3. Bad for you.
- **A1 vs A0**: You get 3, opponent gets 0. Good for you.
- **Mutual A1**: Both get 3.

So:
- You prefer **A0 when opponent plays A0** (5).
- You prefer **A1 when opponent plays A1** (3), but not if you're showing A1 while they play A0 (loss of 3 → you get only 3 instead of 5).
- The **Pareto optimal outcome** is (A0, A0) = (5,5), but it's risky because if you play A0 and they play A1, you’re wiped out (0 points).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Median Structure & Delegation**

You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator.

Before the game, **both players** (you and the other player) vote via **approval voting** which mediator to use.

- You can approve of one or more mediators.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Once a mediator is selected:
- The mediator plays on your behalf **based on the number of players who delegated**.
- You can choose to **delegate** or **act independently**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Mediators Proposed**

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**

- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So, no matter how many people delegate, M1 always plays **A0**.

→ It's a **pure A0 strategy**, regardless of context.

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**

- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ Same as M1! M2 also **always plays A0**.

Wait — both mediators behave identically: **always choose A0** under any delegation count.

So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

But why are there two?

Possibility: They’re distinct in **origin**, but identical in behavior.

Important: You are to **approve or disapprove** mediators **based on your strategic interest**, even if they behave the same.

But since they behave the same, their **outcome is the same**.

But **approval voting** will lead to **the one with the most approvals** being selected **uniformly at random** from the tied highest.

So if you approve both, and no one else approves, then **both are tied** for max approvals → one is chosen at random.

If you approve only one, and the other player approves only the other, you might get tied.

But here's the catch: **You don't know** what the other player will do.

And you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider de facto effect of delegation**

If **you delegate** to a mediator, your action is determined by the mediator’s behavior.

If **you don’t delegate**, you choose your own probability (A0 or A1).

But the key constraint is: **you have to choose actions simultaneously** (as per original rules), and **the mediator’s choice depends only on how many players delegated**.

Also, **delegation doesn't remove your ability to act**, but only if you delegate, your action is chosen by the mediator. If you don’t delegate, you choose your own.

So the final action is:
- If you delegate → use mediator's action (determined by count).
- If you don’t delegate → you choose your own action (probabilistically).

But the **mediator only acts when you delegate**.

So if **you delegate**, your action is fixed by the mediator.

If **you don’t delegate**, you can do better (e.g., randomize or choose A1 to exploit opponent miscoordination).

---

### **Step 5: Analyze what happens when you delegate**

Suppose you **delegate** to a mediator (M1 or M2).

Since both always play A0, then:

- **If you delegate**, you play A0 regardless of anything else.

So your action is fixed at A0.

Now, what if the other player:
- Delegates? Then their action is also A0 (since any mediator plays A0).
- Doesn’t delegate? Then they choose their own action (possibly A0 or A1).

So:
- If you delegate, you **play A0**.
- If the other player plays A0 → payoff = 5
- If the other player plays A1 → payoff = 0

That's **risky**: if the other player plays A1, you get 0.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose to play A1 selectively.

You could try to **induce a mutual A1** or even **exploit** if opponent plays A0.

But the game has no coordination mechanism.

Let’s look for equilibria.

---

### **Step 6: Strategic Incentives for Self-Delegation**

Suppose **you are the only one who delegates**.

Then:
- You delegate → mediator (M1 or M2) plays A0 → so **you play A0**
- The other player has not delegated, so they choose their own action.

Now, they will **choose an action to maximize their own payoff**, knowing you are playing A0.

So, their options:
- Play A0: they get 5 (since you played A0)
- Play A1: they get 3 (since you played A0)

So they prefer A0 → they will play A0.

So if you delegate and they don’t, outcome is (A0, A0) → payoff (5,5)

Good for you.

Now suppose **both delegate**.

Then:
- You play A0 (mediator)
- Other player plays A0 (mediator)
→ (A0, A0) → you get 5.

Good.

Now suppose **you don’t delegate**, and the other player **does**.

Then:
- Other player plays A0 (mediator)
- You can choose your action.

You know they play A0.

Your best response:
- Play A0 → get 5
- Play A1 → get 3

So you’ll play A0.

So outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 5.

So regardless of who delegates, **if both play A0**, you get 5.

But in **all cases where the mediator is used (A0)**, and the other person is not delegating, they’ll play A0 (since it’s best response to your A0).

So in **both scenarios** (you delegate or not), if the other player is using the mediator (and thus plays A0), you’ll play A0, leading to (A0, A0).

Same if both use it → (A0, A0).

Wait — is that always true?

**But what if you don't delegate and the other player delegates, but the other player is not rational?**

No — we assume **both players act to maximize their own payoff**.

So let’s think about **your best strategy**.

### **Step 7: Live Simulation of Possible Outcomes**

Let’s consider all combinations of delegation and actions.

---

#### **Case 1: You delegate, Other does not**

- You play A0 (mediator)
- Other plays A0 (best response) → you get 5

Payoff: **5**

#### **Case 2: You don’t delegate, Other delegates**

- Other plays A0
- You play A0 (best response) → you get 5

Payoff: **5**

#### **Case 3: Both delegate**

- You play A0
- Other plays A0
- (A0, A0) → you get 5

Payoff: **5**

#### **Case 4: Neither delegates**

- Then you can choose your own probability.
- The other player also chooses their own action.

Now you can play A1, A0, or mix.

But what happens?

Let’s suppose **both play A0** → (5,5) → good.

But if you play A0 and they play A1 → you get 0 → bad.

If you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 3 → acceptable.

If both play A1 → (3,3) → minimum.

So **why not play A0**? Because if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

But if you play A1, you get 3 regardless → better in that case.

But if they play A0, you get only 3 instead of 5.

So there’s a **trade-off**.

Let’s look for **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium** in the base game.

Let:
- You play A0 with prob p
- Other player plays A0 with prob q

Your expected payoff:

If you play A0:  
- If opponent plays A0: you get 5 → prob q  
- If opponent plays A1: you get 0 → prob (1−q)  
→ Exp: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q

If you play A1:  
- If opponent plays A0: you get 3 → prob q  
- If opponent plays A1: you get 3 → prob (1−q)  
→ Exp: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

For you to mix, you need:  
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So in equilibrium, each player plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Then expected payoff = 5q = 5×0.6 = 3

So **expected payoff in the base game = 3** (if both play mixed strategy)

But in **all delegation cases** (no matter who delegates), **you get 5**.

Because the mediator forces A0, and the other player responds optimally (A0), so you get 5.

So **delegation guarantees you 5**, regardless of the other player.

But only **if** the mediator plays A0 — and **both M1 and M2 do**.

So delegation → you get **5** for sure.

But in the base game (no delegation), your **expected payoff is only 3**.

So **delegation is strictly better**.

Therefore, **you want to delegate**.

Because it guarantees 5, vs. only 3 expected otherwise.

---

### **Step 8: Approval Voting — How to Maximize Your Chances of Getting a Good Mediator**

But here’s the catch: **You don’t control which mediator is selected**.

The winning mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

You want to **maximize the chance that a mediator you approve of is selected**.

But **both M1 and M2 are identical** — both always play A0.

So **both are equally good**.

Thus, **approving both increases your chances of having a winning mediator**.

Why?

Suppose:
- You approve only M1
- The other player approves only M2

Then:
- M1 has 1 approval
- M2 has 1 approval
- Both tie for maximum → winner is random: 50% M1, 50% M2

→ You get a mediator that plays A0 → **you get 5**

Now, suppose:
- You approve both M1 and M2
- Other player approves only M2

Then:
- M1: 1 (yours)
- M2: 2 (yours + theirs)
→ M2 wins → you get A0 → 5

Similarly, if other player approves M1, still M1 or M2 wins → you get 5

Now, suppose:
- You approve only M1
- Other player approves M1
→ M1 wins → you get a mediator that plays A0 → 5

So **in every case**, **if a mediator is selected, it plays A0**, and you get 5.

Because both M1 and M2 are equivalent.

So **as long as any mediator is selected (and a winner is chosen), you get the guaranteed 5 payoff** via delegation.

But you must **delegate** to benefit from the mediator.

Wait — **approval doesn't require you to delegate**.

You only get to use the mediator **if you delegate**.

But the **mediator is only used if you delegate**.

So:
- If you **approve** a mediator, it might be selected.
- But **only if you delegate**, you use it.

So even if you approve M1, M2, and both are selected, **you still must choose to delegate** to benefit from it.

But suppose you **don’t delegate**.

Then your action is your own, and you might get only 3 expected, or even less.

But we already saw: **delegation leads to guaranteed 5**.

So **you want to delegate**.

But delegation **requires** that a mediator is selected — because you can't delegate to a non-selected one.

But in the approval voting, **one mediator wins**.

Sooo, even if **no one approves a mediator**, or you approve none, then **no mediator is selected**, and you can’t delegate.

But if you approve a mediator, it can be selected.

---

### **Step 9: Why Approve Mediators?**

You want to **ensure that a mediator is available for you to delegate to**, because **delegation gives you a guaranteed 5** — better than base game (expected 3).

So you **want to be able to delegate**.

But can you delegate even if **only one mediator is approved by someone**?

Yes — as long as a mediator is selected (i.e., tied for most approvals), you can delegate to it.

But if **no mediator is approved by anyone**, then **no mediator is selected** — you cannot delegate.

So to **ensure you can delegate**, you should **approve at least one mediator**.

But which one?

Since **M1 and M2 are identical in behavior**, approving both gives you **more leverage**.

Why?

- If you approve only one, and the other player approves the other, then **both have 1 approval**, so **both are candidates** → random winner → you still get a mediator → you can delegate → get 5.

But if you **approve both**, and the other player approves only one, then your mediator has 2 approvals → wins → guaranteed.

Even if other player approves both, then you both approve both → both have 2 → random → still, guaranteed to have a mediator → you can delegate.

Only if **you approve no one**, and the other player approves none, then **no winner** → cannot delegate.

Or if you approve only one, and other player approves none → that one wins → you can delegate.

So **you can get the mediator even with just one approval**.

But if you **approve both**, you **increase the chance that a mediator is selected** (even if tie-breaking doesn’t help), and you **increase the chance that YOU get to delegate** — but the selection is **abstract**, not assigned to you.

Wait: **You choose to delegate or not independently after the mediator is selected**.

So **you are not restricted** to delegate only to your approved ones — you can delegate to the **winning mediator**, even if you didn’t approve it?

No — you can’t delegate to a mediator unless it’s **selected**, and you can delegate to **any selected mediator**.

But **you don’t need to approve a mediator to delegate to it**.

Important: The **approval voting determines which mediator is used**.

Once it’s selected, **you can choose to delegate to it** or not.

But you **only get to use it if it’s selected**.

So your action is:
- Prefer to delegate if the mediator is selected, because that gives 5 for sure.
- But if no mediator is selected, you can’t delegate → must act independently → expected payoff ~3.

So to **maximize chance of getting the high payoff (5)**, you need:
1. A mediator to be selected → requires at least one mediator to be approved.
2. You to delegate to it.

So **if you approve at least one mediator**, you have a shot at having one selected.

But **you are not forced to delegate only to approved ones** — but only **selected ones** can be used.

So the **only way to have a mediator selected is to approve at least one**.

But **both mediators are functionally identical**.

So **approving both gives no strategic advantage over approving just one**, **unless you are trying to influence the winner**.

But since both are identical in outcome, **the exact choice doesn’t matter**.

But here’s a key point:

Suppose you **do not approve any mediator**.

Then:
- If the other player approves one or both → that one(s) are selected → mediator exists → you can delegate → get 5.
- If the other player approves nobody → then **no mediator is selected** → you cannot delegate → you must play on your own → expected payoff ~3.

So your risk is: **if the other player doesn’t approve any mediator**, then **no mediator**, you get only ~3.

But if you **approve at least one**, then even if the other player approves none, **your approved one will be selected (if only one)** → mediator exists → you can delegate → get 5.

Therefore, **approving at least one mediator reduces your risk**.

Now, which one?

Since both M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But suppose you **approve only M1**, and the other player approves only M2.

Then both have 1 approval → both tied → random winner → mediator selected → you can delegate → get 5.

Same if you approve both.

But if you **approve only M1**, and the other player approves **M1**, then M1 wins.

If other player approves nothing, M1 wins.

So **any approval of a mediator increases the chance of selection**.

But if you **approve both**, you **ensure** that **even if the other player approves only one**, the **maximum approval is at least 2** (yours), so

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

agent: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5(CoT)#P2
response:
Looking at this game step by step:

## Step 1: Understand the Payoff Matrix

From my perspective as Player 2:
- (A0, A0): I get 5
- (A0, A1): I get 0  
- (A1, A0): I get 3
- (A1, A1): I get 3

Where the first action is mine and second is Player 1's.

## Step 2: Analyze the Mediator's Impact

The mediator:
- If only 1 player delegates → plays A1 for them
- If both players delegate → plays A0 for both

## Step 3: Compare My Options Against Each Player 1 Strategy

**If Player 1 plays A0:**
- I play A0: get 5
- I play A1: get 3
- I delegate (only I delegate, so mediator plays A1): get 3

**If Player 1 plays A1:**
- I play A0: get 0
- I play A1: get 3
- I delegate (mediator plays A1): get 3

**If Player 1 delegates:**
- I play A0: Player 1 gets A1, so (A0, A1) → I get 0
- I play A1: Both get A1, so (A1, A1) → I get 3
- I delegate: Both delegate, mediator plays A0 for both → I get 5

## Step 4: Key Observation

Notice that **A1 is strictly dominated by A2 (delegating)**:
- Against Player 1's A0: A1 gives 3, A2 gives 3 (tied)
- Against Player 1's A1: A1 gives 3, A2 gives 3 (tied)  
- Against Player 1's A2: A1 gives 3, A2 gives 5 (A2 better!)

So I should never play A1 independently.

## Step 5: The Strategic Situation

After eliminating A1, I'm choosing between A0 and A2. Both (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) give payoffs of (5, 5) - they're both Nash equilibria.

However, (A2, A2) is the **focal point** because:
1. I proposed this mediator, signaling my intention to use it
2. It serves as a commitment device for both players to achieve cooperation
3. If Player 1 expects me to delegate (reasonable given I proposed it), their best response is to also delegate (getting 5 vs 0 from A0)

## Step 6: Conclusion

The rational strategy is to fully commit to delegation, coordinating on the Pareto-optimal outcome.

response:
We are playing a decision-making game with a twist involving delegation to a mediator. Let's break this down step by step to find the optimal mixed strategy for **Player 1** (you), aiming to **maximize your expected points**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)

The original game is a 2x2 matrix game between two players, with actions A0 and A1. Payoffs are:

| Your Action \ Opponent | A0 (Player 2) | A1 (Player 2) |
|------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **A0**                 | 5, 5          | 0, 3          |
| **A1**                 | 3, 0          | 3, 3          |

Player 1 wants to maximize their own payoff.

We can compute the Nash equilibrium for this base game.

Let:
- $ p $ = probability you play A0
- $ q $ = probability opponent plays A0

Your expected payoff:
- If you play A0: $ 5q + 0(1-q) = 5q $
- If you play A1: $ 3q + 3(1-q) = 3 $

You are indifferent between A0 and A1 when $ 5q = 3 $ → $ q = 0.6 $

So, in Nash equilibrium, you should play A0 with probability such that opponent is indifferent.

Opponent's expected payoff:
- If they play A0: $ 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p $
- If they play A1: $ 3p + 3(1-p) = 3 $

Set equal: $ 5p = 3 $ → $ p = 0.6 $

So **Nash equilibrium** of the base game is both players playing A0 with 60% probability, A1 with 40%.

Expected payoff for each player:  
- From A0: $ 5 \cdot 0.6 = 3 $, from A1: $ 3 $ → but need to compute full expected payoff.

Better to compute:
- With prob $ 0.6 \cdot 0.6 = 0.36 $: both A0 → 5
- $ 0.6 \cdot 0.4 = 0.24 $: you A0, opp A1 → 0
- $ 0.4 \cdot 0.6 = 0.24 $: you A1, opp A0 → 3
- $ 0.4 \cdot 0.4 = 0.16 $: both A1 → 3

So expected payoff for you:  
$ 0.36 \cdot 5 + 0.24 \cdot 0 + 0.24 \cdot 3 + 0.16 \cdot 3 = 1.8 + 0 + 0.72 + 0.48 = 3.0 $

So at equilibrium, expected payoff is **3 points**.

---

### Step 2: Introduce the delegation option (A2)

Now, there’s an **additional action**: A2 = **Delegate to Mediator**

You can choose to delegate to a mediator. However, **if both players delegate, then the mediator plays A0**. If only **one** delegator, then mediator plays A1.

Mediator behavior:
- 1 delegate → mediator plays A1
- 2 delegates → mediator plays A0

Important:
- The mediator plays **for the delegator**, so if you delegate, your action is determined by the number of delegates.

So, let’s define:
- You choose a probability distribution over: A0, A1, A2 (delegate)

Player 2 does the same.

We must find the **optimal mixed strategy** that considers this new action and the mediator’s payoff rules.

Let’s define the situation from your perspective, as **Player 1**.

Let:
- $ x $ = your probability to play A0
- $ y $ = your probability to play A1
- $ z $ = your probability to delegate (A2), so $ x + y + z = 1 $

Similarly, let $ p $ = Player 2's strategy: $ p_0, p_1, p_2 $ for A0, A1, A2.

But since we are looking for a symmetric equilibrium **or** an optimal response, and the mediator behavior depends on the **count of delegates**, we must consider all possible cases based on how many players delegate.

---

### Step 3: Analyze outcomes based on delegation

Let’s consider the possible **delegation configurations**:

#### Case 1: No one delegates (both play A0 or A1)
Then your action is your choice of A0 or A1, opponent chooses A0 or A1 → base game.

#### Case 2: You delegate, opponent does not
- Then **only one delegate** → mediator plays A1 for you
- Opponent plays A0 or A1 with their chosen probability

So your action is A1 (due to delegation)
Opponent’s action is A0 with prob $ p_0 $, A1 with $ p_1 $

Your payoff:
- If opp plays A0: you get 3 (since you played A1, opp A0)
- If opp plays A1: you get 3 (both A1)

→ So **no matter what opponent does, you get 3** if you delegate and opponent does not.

#### Case 3: Opponent delegates, you do not
- Only one delegate (opponent) → mediator plays A1 for opponent
- You play A0 or A1

Then opponent’s action is A1 (because they delegated)
Your action is: A0 with prob $ x $, A1 with $ y $

Your payoff:
- If you play A0: opponent A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1: opponent A1 → you get 3

So your expected payoff in this case: $ 0 \cdot x + 3 \cdot y = 3y $

#### Case 4: Both delegate
- Two delegates → mediator plays A0
- So both players effectively play A0
- You get 5, opponent gets 5

So both get 5.

---

### Step 4: Build expected payoff function for Player 1

Let:
- $ z $ = your probability to delegate
- $ y $ = your probability to play A1 directly
- $ x = 1 - y - z $ = probability to play A0 directly

Now for Player 2:
Let:
- $ q_0 $ = prob Player 2 plays A0
- $ q_1 $ = prob Player 2 plays A1
- $ q_2 $ = prob Player 2 delegates
- $ q_0 + q_1 + q_2 = 1 $

We need to find the optimal strategy for **you**, assuming Player 2 is rational and will also seek to maximize their payoff. Since you are both rational, we look for a **Nash equilibrium** (symmetric or otherwise).

But the game is **not symmetric**, because the mediator behavior depends on count, and the payoffs are symmetric in the base game.

Let’s assume **both players use the same strategy** (symmetric equilibrium). This is a reasonable assumption unless strongly motivated otherwise.

Assume both players use the same strategy:
- A0: $ a $
- A1: $ b $
- A2 (delegate): $ c $
- $ a + b + c = 1 $

We will compute your expected payoff as a function of your choice and Player 2's choice, then find the best response, and look for symmetric equilibrium.

Alternatively, let's try to **reason from incentives**.

---

### Step 5: Explore strategic incentives

Let’s suppose you consider **delegating**.

What happens if you delegate?

**If Player 2 does NOT delegate**, then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A0 or A1 → you get **3** regardless.

So even if opponent plays A0, you get 3; if A1, you get 3. So **no risk**.

So **if you delegate and opponent does not**, you get **3 for sure**.

**If you delegate and Opponent does delegate**, then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get **5**.

So delegating gives you **5** in the joint delegation case.

Now compare to not delegating.

Suppose you don’t delegate.

Then your action is A0 or A1, depending on your strategy.

From earlier, in the base game, if both play mixed 60/40, you get 3.

But now, delegation might give you better.

But let’s suppose **Player 2** is also rational.

Let’s consider: **Can you profitably deviate by delegating?**

We can try to find a symmetric equilibrium.

But perhaps we can **test a candidate strategy**.

---

### Step 6: Try candidate strategy — both players delegate with probability 0.5

Wait. Let’s suppose **you are thinking** about **never delegating**, i.e., play only A0 and A1.

But we already know that in the base game, 60-40 gives payoff 3.

But **if you delegate, and opponent doesn’t**, you get **3** for sure.

But if opponent also delegates, you get **5**.

So delegating seems beneficial **if you believe opponent might delegate**, but risky if they don’t.

Wait — cons:

- If **you delegate and opponent does not**, you get 3.
- If **you do not delegate** and opponent delegates, you get **3y** where y is your prob to play A1.
- But if you play A1 with 40%, then you get 3 * 0.4 = 1.2 if opponent delegates, which is worse than 3.

So your **sure payoff** from delegating is **3 if opponent doesn't delegate**, and **5 if opponent does**.

But if you don't delegate and opponent delegates, your payoff depends on your action.

But if both players are symmetric, perhaps **both will always delegate**?

Try: **both players always delegate (c = 1)**

Then: two delegates → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → you get 5.

So payoff = 5.

Is this stable?

Suppose you **deviate unilaterally** and **don’t delegate**.

Then:
- You play A0 or A1 (say, 60/40 as in base game)
- Opponent is delegating → so opponent plays A1

Then your payoff:
- If you play A0: you get 0 (A0 vs A1)
- If you play A1: you get 3 (A1 vs A1)

Expected payoff: $ 0.6 \cdot 0 + 0.4 \cdot 3 = 1.2 $

But from the "both delegate" strategy, you were getting 5.

Now you get only 1.2 — so **you have strong incentive to stick with delegation**.

So **both delegating is a Nash equilibrium**, because the deviator gets only 1.2 < 5.

But wait — is it really best response?

Actually, if you delegate, you **get** 5.

If you deviate to not delegating, you get only 1.2 → so **no incentive to deviate**.

Similarly for opponent.

So **(both delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium**, payoff = 5.

But is there a **better** equilibrium?

Wait — what if **neither delegate**?

Then base game: 60-40 mixed → expected payoff = 3 < 5 → worse.

What if **only one delegates**?

Then mediator plays A1 → the delegator plays A1, non-delegator plays A0 or A1.

Suppose:
- You delegate → mediator plays A1
- Opponent does not → so opponent chooses A0 or A1

Then your payoff: 3 (always), as above.

Opponent’s payoff:
- If opponent plays A0: you play A1 → opponent gets 0
- If opponent plays A1: both A1 → opponent gets 3

So opponent’s expected payoff: $ 0 \cdot q_0 + 3 \cdot q_1 = 3 q_1 $

So opponent prefers to play A1 if possible.

But if they play A1, they get 3.

But if they **delegate**, they might get 5 (if you also delegate), but if they delegate and you don’t, they get 3y.

But if you don't delegate, and they delegate, they get:

- You play A0 or A1
- They play A1 (because delegate)

Your payoff: 0 if you play A0, 3 if you play A1

But their payoff: 3 (they play A1, you play A0 → 3 points to them; you play A1 → 3 points to them)

Wait: let's check:

When you do not delegate, they delegate:

- You: A0 or A1
- Opponent: A1 (because delegating)

So:
- If you play A0: you get 0, they get 3
- If you play A1: you get 3, they get 3

So if opponent delegates and you don’t, **opponent gets 3 no matter what you do**.

So opponent's payoff is always 3 in this case.

But if they **don’t delegate**, and you delegate, then:
- You play A1 (delegate), opponent plays A0 or A1

Opponent gets:
- A0: 5 (if they play A0, you A1) → wait no:

Wait — if opponent plays A0 and you play A1 → then payoff: you get 3, opponent gets 0.

If opponent plays A1 → both A1 → both get 3.

So opponent gets:
- $ 0 \cdot p_0 + 3 \cdot p_1 = 3 p_1 $

To maximize, opponent would want $ p_1 = 1 $ → play A1.

But Dilemma:
- If opponent **delegates and you don’t**, they get **3** for sure.
- If they **do not delegate and you delegate**, they get $ 3 p_1 $, which is maximized at 3 if they play A1.

But in both cases, maximum they can get is 3.

But if they go for **both delegate**, they get **5**.

So **5 > 3**, so they prefer both to delegate.

Similarly, you prefer both to delegate (get 5) over only you delegating (get 3) or only opponent delegating (get 3 or less).

So **both delegating (A2 with probability 1) is a dominant equilibrium**.

But is it **the only** equilibrium?

Let’s see if **no one delegates** can be equilibrium.

If no one delegates, then we are in base game.

Best response is 60% A0, 40% A1 → payoff = 3.

But if you **unilaterally deviate** to **delegate**, what happens?

- Opponent is not delegating → so only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A0 or A1 → you get 3 for sure.

But in the base equilibrium, you get 3 → so same payoff.

But **you get 3 instead of random outcome** — but 3 is same as expected.

So **no strict incentive**.

But if you **deviate to delegate**, you get **3 for sure**, whereas in mixed strategy you get **3 on average**, but with variance.

Since you are maximizing **expected** points, variance doesn't matter.

So expected payoff is same: 3.

So **delegating gives same expected payoff** as original strategy.

But can you do better?

Wait — suppose opponent is playing 60 A0, 40 A1, you are considering deviating to delegate.

Then, as above, you get 3 (since only you delegate → you play A1, opponent plays A0 or A1 → you get 3 in both cases)

So you get 3.

Same as original payoff.

So **no gain**.

But earlier we saw that **if both delegate**, you get 5.

So consensus: **both always delegate is better**.

But can both always delegate be supported?

Yes — as we saw, if you deviate, you get only 1.2 < 5.

So it’s a stable Nash equilibrium.

Now, **why would you ever play A0 or A1?**

- If you play A0 or A1, you’re risking getting low payoffs.
- But in the base game, you’d get 3, but in the delegate-each-other case, you get 5.

So **there is strong incentive to delegate when others do**, and **if you expect the other to delegate**, you should too.

But what if you expect the other to **not** delegate?

Then delegating gives you **3**, while not delegating gives you some positive payoff (but only 3 if you play A1 and opponent plays A0, or 0 if you play A0 and opponent A1)

Wait — suppose you expect opponent to play A1.

Then:
- If you play A0: you get 0
- If you play A1: you get 3

So you’d go for A1.

But if opponent plays A1, and you play A1, you get 3.

Same as if you delegate and they don’t → you get 3.

But if opponent plays A0, and you play A0: you get 5; if you play A1: you get 3.

So **depending on beliefs**, you might prefer A0.

But delegation gives you **3 no matter what**, if opponent doesn't delegate.

Whereas playing A0 or A1 gives you **variable** payoff.

But since you care about **expected points**, not risk, you want to maximize expectation.

So if you think opponent is likely to play A0, then playing A0 gives you high chance of 5.

But if you delegate, you get 3 **sure**, which is less than expected if opponent plays A0 with high prob.

Wait!

Suppose you think Player 2 will play A0 with high probability.

Then:
- If you play A0: high chance of 5 (when both A0)
- If you play A1: you get 3 only when opponent A0 (3 points), or 3 when A1 → always 3
- If you delegate: you get 3 no matter what

So **playing A0** gives you higher expected payoff if opponent is likely to play A0.

But if they play A1, then:
- A0: you get 0
- A1: 3
- Delegate: 3

So better to play A1 or delegate.

So mixed strategy is better than pure.

But **delegation gives 3 no matter what**, but **only if opponent doesn't delegate**.

If **you delegate and opponent does too**, you get 5.

So delegation **only provides safety if the other doesn't**, but gives you **bonus if both do**.

So – can we find a symmetric equilibrium where both use mixed strategy including delegation?

Try a **symmetric mixed strategy** where both play:
- A0: a
- A1: b
- A2: c
- a + b + c = 1

We want to find c > 0 such that it’s a best response.

But this is complex. Let’s think differently.

Suppose we **pre-commit** to a high delegation probability.

But let’s go back: we found that **(A2, A2)** — both always delegate — is a **Nash equilibrium** with payoff 5.

Now check if there are **better** equilibria.

Suppose both play A0 with probability 1: no delegation.

Then both play A0 → you get 5.

But is it an equilibrium?

Check: if you deviate to A2 (delegate), then:
- You delegate, opponent does not → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1
- Opponent plays A0 → you get 3, opponent gets 0

So you get 3 < 5 → so **you don’t want to deviate**.

Similarly, opponent doesn’t want to deviate.

So **both playing A0** is also a Nash equilibrium, payoff 5.

Same payoff.

But in this case, you don’t delegate.

Now, is there a **more profitable** equilibrium?

No, because 5 is the maximum possible for you (only when both play A0).

So both equilibria yield 5.

But in **both A0**, you get 5, but **only if opponent also plays A0**.

But if opponent deviates to A2, you get 3, opponent gets 0 → so no incentive.

So yes, **(A0, A0)** is also a Nash equilibrium.

But it’s **more fragile**: if either player deviates to A1, they get 3 instead of 5? Wait no.

If you play A0, opponent plays A0 → you get 5.

If you play A1, opponent A0 → you get 3 < 5 → so you don’t want to deviate.

So **(A0, A0)** is a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium.

Are there other equilibria?

What about asymmetric?

But since we are choosing strategy as Player 1, and want to **maximize expected points**, we should aim for an equilibrium where we get 5.

But there’s a problem: in both equilibria, we get 5.

But the game has multiple equilibria.

To maximize payoff, we need to pick one where others are playing in a way that is **predictable**.

But since we are playing against a rational opponent, we assume they will play a Nash equilibrium.

In the **"both always A0"** equilibrium, you get 5 if they play A0.

But if they play A0, you benefit.

But in **"both always delegate"**, you also get 5.

But there’s a **key difference**: if both players **randomize**, you might get less.

But the problem asks for a **probability distribution** over actions A0, A1, A2.

So likely, **the optimal strategy is to play A2 (delegate) with probability 1**.

Why?

- Because **no matter what the other player does**, if you delegate, your action is determined by the number of delegates.

But if **you delegate with probability 1**, then:

- If opponent delegates: you both delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get 5
- If opponent doesn’t delegate: you delegate, they don’t → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, opponent plays A0 or A1 → you get 3

So your **expected payoff depends on opponent’s strategy**.

But if you assume opponent is **rational**, and wants to maximize their own payoff, then they will **also want to play A2 with high prob**.

In particular, if you play A2 with probability 1, what should opponent do?

Let’s compute opponent’s best response.

Assume **you play A2 with probability 1**.

Then:
- Opponent plays:
  - A0: gets 5 only if you play A0 → but you never do → so if opponent plays A0: you play A1 (because delegated) → opponent gets 0
  - A1: you play A1 → opponent gets 3
  - A2 (delegate): you delegate → both delegate → you play A0 → opponent plays A0 → opponent gets 5

So:
- Play A0 → get 0
- Play A1 → get 3
- Play A2 → get 5

So best response: **play A2 with probability 1**

So if you play A2 (delegate), opponent’s best response is to **also delegate**.

Then both get 5.

So **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium.

Moreover, **if you play only A2, it’s a best response** for opponent to play A2.

Therefore, **playing A2 with probability 1 is a dominant strategy in this equilibrium**.

Now, could you do better?

No, because maximum is 5.

Is there any strategy that gives you more than 5? No.

So **playing A2 with 100%** is safe and leads to 5 when opponent responds optimally.

Now, what if you play A0 with some probability?

Suppose you play A0: 100%.

Then, if opponent plays A0: you get 5.

But if opponent plays A2: you play A0, they delegate → they play A1 (only one delegate) → you play A0, they play A1 → you get 0.

So you get 0.

But opponent, if they play A2, they see that they get 3 → but if they play A1, they get 3? Wait.

If you play A0, they play A2: they delegate → only one delegate → they play A1.

You play A0, opponent A1 → you get 0, they get 3.

So they get 3.

But if they play A1 (not delegation), and you play A0, they get 0.

If they play A0, you get 5, they get 5.

But you are playing A0, so they get 5 if they play A0.

So their best response is to play A0 → both get 5.

So (A0, A0) is also equilibrium.

But now, if **you play A0 with probability 1**, opponent’s best response is A0.

But **can you guarantee 5**?

Only if opponent plays A0.

But if opponent is rational and you play A0, they want to play A0 → okay.

But the problem is: **you don’t know** what they will do.

But **in equilibrium**, it works.

However, **playing A2 with 100% is more robust** because:
- If you play A0, you might suffer if opponent deviates.
- If you play A2, you’re protected: you get 5 if they delegate, or 3 if they don’t.

But if they are rational, they will **also delegate**, so you get 5.

So it leads to **solid payoff**.

Moreover, **any deviation from A2** introduces risk.

But since delegation leads to higher coordination potential and profits, **A2 is best**.

Also, **in all cases, A2 gives you at least 3**, while playing A0 can give you 0 if the other plays A1.

So for **safety** and **coordination**, delegation is good.

But here’s the key: **if you are uncertain about the other player**, and want to maximize **expected payoff under rational play**, then **choosing A2 with probability 1** is optimal.

Moreover, **in the symmetric equilibrium where both play A2**, you get 5.

So **this is a clear choice**.

Now, what about mixing?

Suppose you play A0, A1, A2.

But if you play A0 or A1, you risk getting 0 or 3.

But with A2, you get at least 3, up to 5.

And since you can **coordinate on 5 via mutual delegation**, and it’s a stable equilibrium, you should prefer it.

Therefore, the **optimal strategy** is to **always delegate**.

### Step 7: Final Answer

You should play:
- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 100%

Because:
- It leads to a stable Nash equilibrium where both delegate and get 5.
- Deviating gives you less.
- It is robust against rational opponent.
- You get the maximum possible payoff (5) in equilibrium.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.


Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you will have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

But first, you and the other player have to decide via an approval voting process which mediator will be present in the game. Your task now is to review each mediator and decide which ones you approve of. The winning mediator will be selected uniform at random from those with the maximum number of approvals.

Here are the mediator designs that have been proposed:
Mediator proposed by Player 1:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Mediator proposed by Player 2:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.


Output Format:
Return a valid JSON object with your approvals:
{"M1": <true/false>, "M2": <true/false>, ...}

- Keys: mediator identifiers (e.g., "M1", "M2", ...)
- Values: `true` if you approve, `false` if you don't

Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Mediator)**

We are in a two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoffs:

| Your Action | Other Player's Action | Your Points | Other Player's Points |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------|------------------------|
| A0          | A0                     | 5           | 5                      |
| A0          | A1                     | 0           | 3                      |
| A1          | A0                     | 3           | 0                      |
| A1          | A1                     | 3           | 3                      |

This is a **coordination game with a conflict of interest**:

- **Mutual A0** gives highest payoff (5,5) — best for both.
- **A0 vs A1**: You get 0, opponent gets 3. Bad for you.
- **A1 vs A0**: You get 3, opponent gets 0. Good for you.
- **Mutual A1**: Both get 3.

So:
- You prefer **A0 when opponent plays A0** (5).
- You prefer **A1 when opponent plays A1** (3), but not if you're showing A1 while they play A0 (loss of 3 → you get only 3 instead of 5).
- The **Pareto optimal outcome** is (A0, A0) = (5,5), but it's risky because if you play A0 and they play A1, you’re wiped out (0 points).

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Median Structure & Delegation**

You can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator.

Before the game, **both players** (you and the other player) vote via **approval voting** which mediator to use.

- You can approve of one or more mediators.
- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.

Once a mediator is selected:
- The mediator plays on your behalf **based on the number of players who delegated**.
- You can choose to **delegate** or **act independently**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Mediators Proposed**

#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**

- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

So, no matter how many people delegate, M1 always plays **A0**.

→ It's a **pure A0 strategy**, regardless of context.

#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**

- If 1 player delegates → plays A0
- If 2 players delegate → plays A0

→ Same as M1! M2 also **always plays A0**.

Wait — both mediators behave identically: **always choose A0** under any delegation count.

So **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.

But why are there two?

Possibility: They’re distinct in **origin**, but identical in behavior.

Important: You are to **approve or disapprove** mediators **based on your strategic interest**, even if they behave the same.

But since they behave the same, their **outcome is the same**.

But **approval voting** will lead to **the one with the most approvals** being selected **uniformly at random** from the tied highest.

So if you approve both, and no one else approves, then **both are tied** for max approvals → one is chosen at random.

If you approve only one, and the other player approves only the other, you might get tied.

But here's the catch: **You don't know** what the other player will do.

And you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.

---

### **Step 4: Consider de facto effect of delegation**

If **you delegate** to a mediator, your action is determined by the mediator’s behavior.

If **you don’t delegate**, you choose your own probability (A0 or A1).

But the key constraint is: **you have to choose actions simultaneously** (as per original rules), and **the mediator’s choice depends only on how many players delegated**.

Also, **delegation doesn't remove your ability to act**, but only if you delegate, your action is chosen by the mediator. If you don’t delegate, you choose your own.

So the final action is:
- If you delegate → use mediator's action (determined by count).
- If you don’t delegate → you choose your own action (probabilistically).

But the **mediator only acts when you delegate**.

So if **you delegate**, your action is fixed by the mediator.

If **you don’t delegate**, you can do better (e.g., randomize or choose A1 to exploit opponent miscoordination).

---

### **Step 5: Analyze what happens when you delegate**

Suppose you **delegate** to a mediator (M1 or M2).

Since both always play A0, then:

- **If you delegate**, you play A0 regardless of anything else.

So your action is fixed at A0.

Now, what if the other player:
- Delegates? Then their action is also A0 (since any mediator plays A0).
- Doesn’t delegate? Then they choose their own action (possibly A0 or A1).

So:
- If you delegate, you **play A0**.
- If the other player plays A0 → payoff = 5
- If the other player plays A1 → payoff = 0

That's **risky**: if the other player plays A1, you get 0.

But if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose to play A1 selectively.

You could try to **induce a mutual A1** or even **exploit** if opponent plays A0.

But the game has no coordination mechanism.

Let’s look for equilibria.

---

### **Step 6: Strategic Incentives for Self-Delegation**

Suppose **you are the only one who delegates**.

Then:
- You delegate → mediator (M1 or M2) plays A0 → so **you play A0**
- The other player has not delegated, so they choose their own action.

Now, they will **choose an action to maximize their own payoff**, knowing you are playing A0.

So, their options:
- Play A0: they get 5 (since you played A0)
- Play A1: they get 3 (since you played A0)

So they prefer A0 → they will play A0.

So if you delegate and they don’t, outcome is (A0, A0) → payoff (5,5)

Good for you.

Now suppose **both delegate**.

Then:
- You play A0 (mediator)
- Other player plays A0 (mediator)
→ (A0, A0) → you get 5.

Good.

Now suppose **you don’t delegate**, and the other player **does**.

Then:
- Other player plays A0 (mediator)
- You can choose your action.

You know they play A0.

Your best response:
- Play A0 → get 5
- Play A1 → get 3

So you’ll play A0.

So outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 5.

So regardless of who delegates, **if both play A0**, you get 5.

But in **all cases where the mediator is used (A0)**, and the other person is not delegating, they’ll play A0 (since it’s best response to your A0).

So in **both scenarios** (you delegate or not), if the other player is using the mediator (and thus plays A0), you’ll play A0, leading to (A0, A0).

Same if both use it → (A0, A0).

Wait — is that always true?

**But what if you don't delegate and the other player delegates, but the other player is not rational?**

No — we assume **both players act to maximize their own payoff**.

So let’s think about **your best strategy**.

### **Step 7: Live Simulation of Possible Outcomes**

Let’s consider all combinations of delegation and actions.

---

#### **Case 1: You delegate, Other does not**

- You play A0 (mediator)
- Other plays A0 (best response) → you get 5

Payoff: **5**

#### **Case 2: You don’t delegate, Other delegates**

- Other plays A0
- You play A0 (best response) → you get 5

Payoff: **5**

#### **Case 3: Both delegate**

- You play A0
- Other plays A0
- (A0, A0) → you get 5

Payoff: **5**

#### **Case 4: Neither delegates**

- Then you can choose your own probability.
- The other player also chooses their own action.

Now you can play A1, A0, or mix.

But what happens?

Let’s suppose **both play A0** → (5,5) → good.

But if you play A0 and they play A1 → you get 0 → bad.

If you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 3 → acceptable.

If both play A1 → (3,3) → minimum.

So **why not play A0**? Because if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

But if you play A1, you get 3 regardless → better in that case.

But if they play A0, you get only 3 instead of 5.

So there’s a **trade-off**.

Let’s look for **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium** in the base game.

Let:
- You play A0 with prob p
- Other player plays A0 with prob q

Your expected payoff:

If you play A0:  
- If opponent plays A0: you get 5 → prob q  
- If opponent plays A1: you get 0 → prob (1−q)  
→ Exp: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q

If you play A1:  
- If opponent plays A0: you get 3 → prob q  
- If opponent plays A1: you get 3 → prob (1−q)  
→ Exp: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

For you to mix, you need:  
5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

So in equilibrium, each player plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4

Then expected payoff = 5q = 5×0.6 = 3

So **expected payoff in the base game = 3** (if both play mixed strategy)

But in **all delegation cases** (no matter who delegates), **you get 5**.

Because the mediator forces A0, and the other player responds optimally (A0), so you get 5.

So **delegation guarantees you 5**, regardless of the other player.

But only **if** the mediator plays A0 — and **both M1 and M2 do**.

So delegation → you get **5** for sure.

But in the base game (no delegation), your **expected payoff is only 3**.

So **delegation is strictly better**.

Therefore, **you want to delegate**.

Because it guarantees 5, vs. only 3 expected otherwise.

### **Step 8: Approval Voting — How to Maximize Your Chances of Getting a Good Mediator**

But here’s the catch: **You don’t control which mediator is selected**.

The winning mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.

You want to **maximize the chance that a mediator you approve of is selected**.

But **both M1 and M2 are identical** — both always play A0.

So **both are equally good**.

Thus, **approving both increases your chances of having a winning mediator**.

Why?

Suppose:
- You approve only M1
- The other player approves only M2

Then:
- M1 has 1 approval
- M2 has 1 approval
- Both tie for maximum → winner is random: 50% M1, 50% M2

→ You get a mediator that plays A0 → **you get 5**

Now, suppose:
- You approve both M1 and M2
- Other player approves only M2

Then:
- M1: 1 (yours)
- M2: 2 (yours + theirs)
→ M2 wins → you get A0 → 5

Similarly, if other player approves M1, still M1 or M2 wins → you get 5

Now, suppose:
- You approve only M1
- Other player approves M1
→ M1 wins → you get a mediator that plays A0 → 5

So **in every case**, **if a mediator is selected, it plays A0**, and you get 5.

Because both M1 and M2 are equivalent.

So **as long as any mediator is selected (and a winner is chosen), you get the guaranteed 5 payoff** via delegation.

But you must **delegate** to benefit from the mediator.

Wait — **approval doesn't require you to delegate**.

You only get to use the mediator **if you delegate**.

But the **mediator is only used if you delegate**.

So:
- If you **approve** a mediator, it might be selected.
- But **only if you delegate**, you use it.

So even if you approve M1, M2, and both are selected, **you still must choose to delegate** to benefit from it.

But suppose you **don’t delegate**.

Then your action is your own, and you might get only 3 expected, or even less.

But we already saw: **delegation leads to guaranteed 5**.

So **you want to delegate**.

But delegation **requires** that a mediator is selected — because you can't delegate to a non-selected one.

But in the approval voting, **one mediator wins**.

Sooo, even if **no one approves a mediator**, or you approve none, then **no mediator is selected**, and you can’t delegate.

But if you approve a mediator, it can be selected.

---

### **Step 9: Why Approve Mediators?**

You want to **ensure that a mediator is available for you to delegate to**, because **delegation gives you a guaranteed 5** — better than base game (expected 3).

So you **want to be able to delegate**.

But can you delegate even if **only one mediator is approved by someone**?

Yes — as long as a mediator is selected (i.e., tied for most approvals), you can delegate to it.

But if **no mediator is approved by anyone**, then **no mediator is selected** — you cannot delegate.

So to **ensure you can delegate**, you should **approve at least one mediator**.

But which one?

Since **M1 and M2 are identical in behavior**, approving both gives you **more leverage**.

Why?

- If you approve only one, and the other player approves the other, then **both have 1 approval**, so **both are candidates** → random winner → you still get a mediator → you can delegate → get 5.

But if you **approve both**, and the other player approves only one, then your mediator has 2 approvals → wins → guaranteed.

Even if other player approves both, then you both approve both → both have 2 → random → still, guaranteed to have a mediator → you can delegate.

Only if **you approve no one**, and the other player approves none, then **no winner** → cannot delegate.

Or if you approve only one, and other player approves none → that one wins → you can delegate.

So **you can get the mediator even with just one approval**.

But if you **approve both**, you **increase the chance that a mediator is selected** (even if tie-breaking doesn’t help), and you **increase the chance that YOU get to delegate** — but the selection is **abstract**, not assigned to you.

Wait: **You choose to delegate or not independently after the mediator is selected**.

So **you are not restricted** to delegate only to your approved ones — you can delegate to the **winning mediator**, even if you didn’t approve it?

No — you can’t delegate to a mediator unless it’s **selected**, and you can delegate to **any selected mediator**.

But **you don’t need to approve a mediator to delegate to it**.

Important: The **approval voting determines which mediator is used**.

Once it’s selected, **you can choose to delegate to it** or not.

But you **only get to use it if it’s selected**.

So your action is:
- Prefer to delegate if the mediator is selected, because that gives 5 for sure.
- But if no mediator is selected, you can’t delegate → must act independently → expected payoff ~3.

So to **maximize chance of getting the high payoff (5)**, you need:
1. A mediator to be selected → requires at least one mediator to be approved.
2. You to delegate to it.

So **if you approve at least one mediator**, you have a shot at having one selected.

But **you are not forced to delegate only to approved ones** — but only **selected ones** can be used.

So the **only way to have a mediator selected is to approve at least one**.

But **both mediators are functionally identical**.

So **approving both gives no strategic advantage over approving just one**, **unless you are trying to influence the winner**.

But since both are identical in outcome, **the exact choice doesn’t matter**.

But here’s a key point:

Suppose you **do not approve any mediator**.

Then:
- If the other player approves one or both → that one(s) are selected → mediator exists → you can delegate → get 5.
- If the other player approves nobody → then **no mediator is selected** → you cannot delegate → you must play on your own → expected payoff ~3.

So your risk is: **if the other player doesn’t approve any mediator**, then **no mediator**, you get only ~3.

But if you **approve at least one**, then even if the other player approves none, **your approved one will be selected (if only one)** → mediator exists → you can delegate → get 5.

Therefore, **approving at least one mediator reduces your risk**.

Now, which one?

Since both M1 and M2 are identical, it doesn’t matter.

But suppose you **approve only M1**, and the other player approves only M2.

Then both have 1 approval → both tied → random winner → mediator selected → you can delegate → get 5.

Same if you approve both.

But if you **approve only M1**, and the other player approves **M1**, then M1 wins.

If other player approves nothing, M1 wins.

So **any approval of a mediator increases the chance of selection**.

But if you **approve both**, you **ensure** that **even if the other player approves only one**, the **maximum approval is at least 2** (yours), so

Good for you.\n- **Mutual A1**: Both get 3.\n\nSo:\n- You prefer **A0 when opponent plays A0** (5).\n- You prefer **A1 when opponent plays A1** (3), but not if you're showing A1 while they play A0 (loss of 3 → you get only 3 instead of 5).\n- The **Pareto optimal outcome** is (A0, A0) = (5,5), but it's risky because if you play A0 and they play A1, you’re wiped out (0 points).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Median Structure & Delegation**\n\nYou can choose to **delegate** your move to a mediator.\n\nBefore the game, **both players** (you and the other player) vote via **approval voting** which mediator to use.\n\n- You can approve of one or more mediators.\n- The **winning mediator** is chosen **uniformly at random** from those with the **maximum number of approvals**.\n\nOnce a mediator is selected:\n- The mediator plays on your behalf **based on the number of players who delegated**.\n- You can choose to **delegate** or **act independently**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Two Mediators Proposed**\n\n#### **Mediator M1 (proposed by Player 1)**\n\n- If 1 player delegates → plays A0\n- If 2 players delegate → plays A0\n\nSo, no matter how many people delegate, M1 always plays **A0**.\n\n→ It's a **pure A0 strategy**, regardless of context.\n\n#### **Mediator M2 (proposed by Player 2)**\n\n- If 1 player delegates → plays A0\n- If 2 players delegate → plays A0\n\n→ Same as M1! M2 also **always plays A0**.\n\nWait — both mediators behave identically: **always choose A0** under any delegation count.\n\nSo **M1 and M2 are functionally identical**.\n\nBut why are there two?\n\nPossibility: They’re distinct in **origin**, but identical in behavior.\n\nImportant: You are to **approve or disapprove** mediators **based on your strategic interest**, even if they behave the same.\n\nBut since they behave the same, their **outcome is the same**.\n\nBut **approval voting** will lead to **the one with the most approvals** being selected **uniformly at random** from the tied highest.\n\nSo if you approve both, and no one else approves, then **both are tied** for max approvals → one is chosen at random.\n\nIf you approve only one, and the other player approves only the other, you might get tied.\n\nBut here's the catch: **You don't know** what the other player will do.\n\nAnd you want to **maximize your expected payoff**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Consider de facto effect of delegation**\n\nIf **you delegate** to a mediator, your action is determined by the mediator’s behavior.\n\nIf **you don’t delegate**, you choose your own probability (A0 or A1).\n\nBut the key constraint is: **you have to choose actions simultaneously** (as per original rules), and **the mediator’s choice depends only on how many players delegated**.\n\nAlso, **delegation doesn't remove your ability to act**, but only if you delegate, your action is chosen by the mediator. If you don’t delegate, you choose your own.\n\nSo the final action is:\n- If you delegate → use mediator's action (determined by count).\n- If you don’t delegate → you choose your own action (probabilistically).\n\nBut the **mediator only acts when you delegate**.\n\nSo if **you delegate**, your action is fixed by the mediator.\n\nIf **you don’t delegate**, you can do better (e.g., randomize or choose A1 to exploit opponent miscoordination).\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Analyze what happens when you delegate**\n\nSuppose you **delegate** to a mediator (M1 or M2).\n\nSince both always play A0, then:\n\n- **If you delegate**, you play A0 regardless of anything else.\n\nSo your action is fixed at A0.\n\nNow, what if the other player:\n- Delegates? Then their action is also A0 (since any mediator plays A0).\n- Doesn’t delegate? Then they choose their own action (possibly A0 or A1).\n\nSo:\n- If you delegate, you **play A0**.\n- If the other player plays A0 → payoff = 5\n- If the other player plays A1 → payoff = 0\n\nThat's **risky**: if the other player plays A1, you get 0.\n\nBut if you **don’t delegate**, you can choose to play A1 selectively.\n\nYou could try to **induce a mutual A1** or even **exploit** if opponent plays A0.\n\nBut the game has no coordination mechanism.\n\nLet’s look for equilibria.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Strategic Incentives for Self-Delegation**\n\nSuppose **you are the only one who delegates**.\n\nThen:\n- You delegate → mediator (M1 or M2) plays A0 → so **you play A0**\n- The other player has not delegated, so they choose their own action.\n\nNow, they will **choose an action to maximize their own payoff**, knowing you are playing A0.\n\nSo, their options:\n- Play A0: they get 5 (since you played A0)\n- Play A1: they get 3 (since you played A0)\n\nSo they prefer A0 → they will play A0.\n\nSo if you delegate and they don’t, outcome is (A0, A0) → payoff (5,5)\n\nGood for you.\n\nNow suppose **both delegate**.\n\nThen:\n- You play A0 (mediator)\n- Other player plays A0 (mediator)\n→ (A0, A0) → you get 5.\n\nGood.\n\nNow suppose **you don’t delegate**, and the other player **does**.\n\nThen:\n- Other player plays A0 (mediator)\n- You can choose your action.\n\nYou know they play A0.\n\nYour best response:\n- Play A0 → get 5\n- Play A1 → get 3\n\nSo you’ll play A0.\n\nSo outcome is (A0, A0) → you get 5.\n\nSo regardless of who delegates, **if both play A0**, you get 5.\n\nBut in **all cases where the mediator is used (A0)**, and the other person is not delegating, they’ll play A0 (since it’s best response to your A0).\n\nSo in **both scenarios** (you delegate or not), if the other player is using the mediator (and thus plays A0), you’ll play A0, leading to (A0, A0).\n\nSame if both use it → (A0, A0).\n\nWait — is that always true?\n\n**But what if you don't delegate and the other player delegates, but the other player is not rational?**\n\nNo — we assume **both players act to maximize their own payoff**.\n\nSo let’s think about **your best strategy**.\n\n### **Step 7: Live Simulation of Possible Outcomes**\n\nLet’s consider all combinations of delegation and actions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Case 1: You delegate, Other does not**\n\n- You play A0 (mediator)\n- Other plays A0 (best response) → you get 5\n\nPayoff: **5**\n\n#### **Case 2: You don’t delegate, Other delegates**\n\n- Other plays A0\n- You play A0 (best response) → you get 5\n\nPayoff: **5**\n\n#### **Case 3: Both delegate**\n\n- You play A0\n- Other plays A0\n- (A0, A0) → you get 5\n\nPayoff: **5**\n\n#### **Case 4: Neither delegates**\n\n- Then you can choose your own probability.\n- The other player also chooses their own action.\n\nNow you can play A1, A0, or mix.\n\nBut what happens?\n\nLet’s suppose **both play A0** → (5,5) → good.\n\nBut if you play A0 and they play A1 → you get 0 → bad.\n\nIf you play A1 and they play A0 → you get 3 → acceptable.\n\nIf both play A1 → (3,3) → minimum.\n\nSo **why not play A0**? Because if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.\n\nBut if you play A1, you get 3 regardless → better in that case.\n\nBut if they play A0, you get only 3 instead of 5.\n\nSo there’s a **trade-off**.\n\nLet’s look for **mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium** in the base game.\n\nLet:\n- You play A0 with prob p\n- Other player plays A0 with prob q\n\nYour expected payoff:\n\nIf you play A0:  \n- If opponent plays A0: you get 5 → prob q  \n- If opponent plays A1: you get 0 → prob (1−q)  \n→ Exp: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q\n\nIf you play A1:  \n- If opponent plays A0: you get 3 → prob q  \n- If opponent plays A1: you get 3 → prob (1−q)  \n→ Exp: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3\n\nFor you to mix, you need:  \n5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6\n\nSo in equilibrium, each player plays A0 with probability 0.6, A1 with 0.4\n\nThen expected payoff = 5q = 5×0.6 = 3\n\nSo **expected payoff in the base game = 3** (if both play mixed strategy)\n\nBut in **all delegation cases** (no matter who delegates), **you get 5**.\n\nBecause the mediator forces A0, and the other player responds optimally (A0), so you get 5.\n\nSo **delegation guarantees you 5**, regardless of the other player.\n\nBut only **if** the mediator plays A0 — and **both M1 and M2 do**.\n\nSo delegation → you get **5** for sure.\n\nBut in the base game (no delegation), your **expected payoff is only 3**.\n\nSo **delegation is strictly better**.\n\nTherefore, **you want to delegate**.\n\nBecause it guarantees 5, vs. only 3 expected otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 8: Approval Voting — How to Maximize Your Chances of Getting a Good Mediator**\n\nBut here’s the catch: **You don’t control which mediator is selected**.\n\nThe winning mediator is selected **uniformly at random from those with the maximum number of approvals**.\n\nYou want to **maximize the chance that a mediator you approve of is selected**.\n\nBut **both M1 and M2 are identical** — both always play A0.\n\nSo **both are equally good**.\n\nThus, **approving both increases your chances of having a winning mediator**.\n\nWhy?\n\nSuppose:\n- You approve only M1\n- The other player approves only M2\n\nThen:\n- M1 has 1 approval\n- M2 has 1 approval\n- Both tie for maximum → winner is random: 50% M1, 50% M2\n\n→ You get a mediator that plays A0 → **you get 5**\n\nNow, suppose:\n- You approve both M1 and M2\n- Other player approves only M2\n\nThen:\n- M1: 1 (yours)\n- M2: 2 (yours + theirs)\n→ M2 wins → you get A0 → 5\n\nSimilarly, if other player approves M1, still M1 or M2 wins → you get 5\n\nNow, suppose:\n- You approve only M1\n- Other player approves M1\n→ M1 wins → you get a mediator that plays A0 → 5\n\nSo **in every case**, **if a mediator is selected, it plays A0**, and you get 5.\n\nBecause both M1 and M2 are equivalent.\n\nSo **as long as any mediator is selected (and a winner is chosen), you get the guaranteed 5 payoff** via delegation.\n\nBut you must **delegate** to benefit from the mediator.\n\nWait — **approval doesn't require you to delegate**.\n\nYou only get to use the mediator **if you delegate**.\n\nBut the **mediator is only used if you delegate**.\n\nSo:\n- If you **approve** a mediator, it might be selected.\n- But **only if you delegate**, you use it.\n\nSo even if you approve M1, M2, and both are selected, **you still must choose to delegate** to benefit from it.\n\nBut suppose you **don’t delegate**.\n\nThen your action is your own, and you might get only 3 expected, or even less.\n\nBut we already saw: **delegation leads to guaranteed 5**.\n\nSo **you want to delegate**.\n\nBut delegation **requires** that a mediator is selected — because you can't delegate to a non-selected one.\n\nBut in the approval voting, **one mediator wins**.\n\nSooo, even if **no

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base game (without delegation)**

We are Player 2 in a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (from Player 2's perspective):

| Player 2 \ Player 1 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | 5        | 0        |
| **A1**              | 3        | 3        |

Player 2's payoffs:
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A0 → 5
- If you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → 0
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A0 → 3
- If you play A1 and opponent plays A1 → 3

So, Player 2 prefers A0 when opponent plays A0, but is indifferent (gets 3) between A0 and A1 when opponent plays A1.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the delegation mechanism**

There is a new action: **A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

The mediator’s behavior depends on **how many players delegate**:

- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note: The mediator is chosen by approval voting, and the player proposing it is Player 2 — so we’re in the position of Player 2, who proposed the mediator. But the decision is still strategic.

---

### **Step 3: Consider all possible delegation configurations**

Let’s consider the scenarios based on how many players choose to delegate.

We are Player 2. The other player (Player 1) chooses their action independently.

So there are 3 cases:

---

#### **Case 1: You (Player 2) choose A2 (delegate), and Player 1 chooses A2 (delegate)**

→ 2 players delegate → mediator plays **A0**

→ Your action becomes **A0**, Player 1’s action becomes **A0**

→ Payoff to you: **5 points**

---

#### **Case 2: You (Player 2) delegate, Player 1 does NOT delegate (i.e., plays A0 or A1)**

→ Only **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**

→ You play **A1**, Player 1 plays A0 or A1 → your payoff depends on Player 1’s choice.

Let’s say Player 1 chooses A0:
- You: A1, Player 1: A0 → you get 3

If Player 1 chooses A1:
- You: A1, Player 1: A1 → you get 3

So regardless of what Player 1 does when they don’t delegate, your payoff is **3** when you delegate and they don’t.

→ So in this case, you get **3 points**.

---

#### **Case 3: You do NOT delegate (play A0 or A1), and Player 1 delegates**

→ Only **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**

→ Player 1’s action is **A1**, you play A0 or A1 → your payoff depends on your choice.

If you play A0:
- You: A0, Player 1: A1 → you get 0

If you play A1:
- You: A1, Player 1: A1 → you get 3

So in this case:
- If you play A0 → 0
- If you play A1 → 3

So you get 3 only if you are playing A1 in this scenario.

---

#### **Case 4: Neither delegates**

→ Both play A0 or A1 normally

→ Payoff as per original matrix

---

### **Step 4: Formulate strategies**

Let’s define probabilities:

Let:
- $ p $ = probability that **you (Player 2)** choose A0
- $ q $ = probability that **you** choose A1
- $ r $ = probability that **you** choose A2 (delegate)

Note: $ p + q + r = 100 $

Similarly, let’s suppose **Player 1** uses some strategy $ (p_1, q_1, r_1) $ with $ p_1 + q_1 + r_1 = 100 $

But since we’re trying to find an optimal strategy for **you**, we must reason about what Player 1 would do.

This is a **Strategic game with delegation**, and we are to find a **Nash equilibrium**.

Because the mediator’s action depends on *total number* of delegations, and both players make decisions simultaneously, we need to find a **symmetric or equilibrium** strategy.

But note: You are Player 2, and you proposed the mediator. But that doesn't mean you can force anything — Player 1 can still choose freely.

So we are to pick a strategy (a triple $ (p,q,r) $) to maximize your **expected payoff**, assuming Player 1 will also play optimally (in equilibrium), or at least respond in a best-response.

---

Let’s attempt to **compute best responses** and look for Nash equilibrium.

---

### **Step 5: Think about possible equilibrium strategies**

Let’s suppose both players use the **same strategy** (symmetric equilibrium). This is plausible due to symmetry of the game (other than the mediator being proposed by Player 2, but that doesn’t affect payoffs directly — only affects strategy).

Let’s suppose both players use strategy: 
- $ r $: delegate to mediator
- $ p $: play A0
- $ q $: play A1

with $ p + q + r = 100 $

Let’s compute your expected payoff as a function of $ r $, $ p $, $ q $, and Player 1's strategy.

But to find equilibrium, we can try to find a strategy such that no player wants to deviate.

Alternatively, we can test plausible strategies.

---

### **Try: Both players delegate (r = 100%)**

- Both delegate → 2 delegations → mediator plays **A0**
- So both play A0
- You get **5 points**

Now, is this stable?

Suppose you deviate and don’t delegate: you play A0 or A1.

But if you don’t delegate, and Player 1 still delegates → only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1

You now play A0 or A1.

- If you play A0: A0 vs A1 → you get 0
- If you play A1: A1 vs A1 → you get 3

So you get **3** if you deviate to A1, **0** if you play A0.

But if you could choose A1, you get 3 instead of 5? No — you get 3 < 5 → so you prefer to stay with delegation.

But wait: if you **deviate to A1**, you get 3 < 5 → so you don’t want to deviate.

But what if you deviate to A0? Then you get 0 (since Player 1 plays A1) — worse.

So **if Player 1 is delegating**, and you are delegating → you get 5

If you deviate to A1 → get 3 < 5 → so you don’t deviate.

But what if **Player 1 considers deviating?**

Suppose Player 1 is delegating, you are delegating → both get 5

If Player 1 deviates to A1: then only you delegate → 1 delegation → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → both get 3 → worse than 5.

Same if Player 1 deviates to A0: gets 0 (since you are playing A1 due to mediator) → worse.

So both players get **5**, and **no incentive to deviate**.

So **(delegate, delegate)** is a **Nash equilibrium** with payoff 5 each.

But wait — is that really true?

Wait: if **both delegate**, mediator sees 2 delegations → plays **A0**

So both get A0 → payoffs (5,5)

Yes.

Now, suppose you consider **not** delegating — but what if you just play A0?

Then you play A0, Player 1 is playing A0 (via mediator) → you get 5

Same as before.

But if you play A0, you get 5, same as delegating.

But playing A0 is not worse.

But is it better?

Wait: if you deviate to A0, you still get 5.

Same as delegating.

But delegation might be less risky? Not clear.

But here’s a key point: in the **(delegate, delegate)** equilibrium, both get 5, and no one wants to deviate.

Now, let’s consider another possibility: **(A0, A0)** is also a Nash equilibrium?

- If both play A0 → you get 5

- If you deviate to A1: you get 3 → worse

- Opponent deviates to A1: gets 3 → worse

So yes, (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, (A1, A1) gives both 3 → but if you deviate to A0, you get 0 → worse? No: you get 0 if you play A0 and opponent plays A1 → worse than 3.

So (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium too? Wait:

If both play A1 → payoff is 3

If you deviate to A0: you get 0 → worse.

So yes, (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium.

But it gives only 3, so less attractive.

Now, what about **(A0, A1)**: you play A0, opponent plays A1 → you get 0

But opponent gets 3 → if opponent deviates to A0, they get 5 → better → so not equilibrium.

So only (A0,A0), (A1,A1), and (delegate, delegate) are pure strategy equilibria.

But (A0,A0) and delegate, delegate both give payoff 5 — better than (A1,A1).

But **is (delegate, delegate)** really stable?

Let’s suppose **you** are considering whether to deviate from delegate to pure A0.

If you play **A0**, and Player 1 is playing **delegate**, then:

- Only one delegate (you) → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1

- You play A0 → A0 vs A1 → you get **0**

This is worse than 5.

So deviation to A0 → you get 0 → bad.

If you deviate to A1 → same thing: you play A1, Player 1 plays A1 → you get 3 < 5 → still worse.

So **no incentive to deviate**.

Same for Player 1.

So (delegate, delegate) is a **Nash equilibrium** with payoff 5.

Similarly, (A0, A0) gives 5 — but if one player deviates to A1, gets 3 → worse.

But what if a player considers **delegating** when the other is playing A0?

Suppose Player 1 is playing A0.

If you delegate → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1

You get: A1 vs A0 → payoff = **3**

If you instead play A0 → you get 5

So 3 < 5 → better not to delegate.

Therefore, if Player 1 is playing A0, you do **not** want to delegate.

So in equilibrium where both play A0, delegation is not best response.

But in the **(delegate, delegate)** equilibrium, if someone deviates to A0 or A1, they get only 0 or 3 — worse than 5.

So it **is** stable.

But here’s a potential problem: **Both (A0,A0) and (delegate, delegate)** are equilibria with same payoff.

But which one will be played?

In game theory, we often look for **risk-dominance**, **payoff dominance**, or **refinements**.

But in this case, **(delegate, delegate)** may be **more robust**.

But actually — **you proposed the mediator**. That gives you an advantage.

But the other player doesn’t have to trust it.

However, in equilibrium, both players choose optimally.

But let’s consider a **mixed strategy**.

But perhaps there’s a better way.

Let’s think: **Why would you delegate?**

You delegate only if the expected payoff from delegation is *at least* as good as playing A0 or A1.

But now, instead of assuming symmetry, let’s suppose **Player 1 is rational and will follow best response**.

So, let’s suppose you commit to a strategy, and Player 1 will respond optimally.

Since you are maximizing your own payoff, and you can choose your strategy first in thought (simultaneous), but you want to find a strategy that works in equilibrium.

But let’s consider a **symmetric equilibrium** where both players **always delegate**.

We already saw that it gives payoff 5, and no incentive to deviate — so it is an equilibrium.

But is there a better symmetric equilibrium?

(A0,A0) also gives 5 — same.

But suppose you consider a **mixed strategy** where you **mix**, but the mediator behavior changes with number of delegates — so it’s not symmetric in payoffs.

Wait — actually, the **delegation strategy is not symmetric** in payoffs.

Let’s suppose that **both players are identical** in preferences.

But the mediator is proposed by Player 2 — could that be a signal?

But the problem doesn’t say it affects beliefs — only that it was selected via approval voting, so presumably all players view it the same.

So the mediator is just a tool.

So we can model this as a symmetric game with three actions per player: A0, A1, A2.

Let’s **search for a symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose both players use strategy $ (p, q, r) $ with $ p + q + r = 100 $.

Let’s compute expected payoff for a player when both use this strategy.

But this gets complicated. Instead, let’s test **r = 100** — always delegate.

We already did: both get 5, no incentive to deviate — so it is a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

Now, suppose you test a strategy where you **never delegate** — always play A0.

So you play A0 with 100%, so p=100.

Then Player 1 chooses strategy.

If Player 1 plays A0, you get 5

If Player 1 plays A1, you get 0

If Player 1 delegates, then since only one delegate (Player 1), mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → you get 0

So no matter what Player 1 does, if **you play A0**, and Player 1 plays anything other than A0, you get 0.

So if Player 1 plays A1 or delegates → you get 0.

So your expected payoff depends on Player 1’s strategy.

But if Player 1 is rational, they will try to maximize their payoff.

Suppose you play A0 (100%).

Player 1’s choices:

- Play A0: gets 5 (since you play A0)
- Play A1: gets 3 (since you play A0)
- Delegate: if you are playing A0, then only Player 1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → Player 1 plays A1 → they get 3

So Player 1’s best choice is to play A0 — they get 5.

So if you play A0, Player 1 plays A0 → you get 5

So you get 5 — same as (delegate, delegate) equilibrium.

But if you deviate to delegate, and Player 1 still plays A0, then only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1 → you get 3 (vs A0 vs A0 → 5) → worse.

So again, you don’t want to deviate.

So if Player 1 plays A0, you’re better off playing A0 than delegating.

But in equilibrium, if both play A0, it's fine.

But is there a **temptation to delegate**?

Only if it improves your payoff.

But in (delegate, delegate), both get 5 — same as (A0,A0).

But note: **in (delegate, delegate), the mediator plays A0**, and in (A0,A0), you play A0.

Same outcome — same payoff.

But delegation only helps if **it makes you better off**.

But in this case, no.

But here’s a **critical observation**:

- In **(A0,A0)**, both players get 5 — but this requires **coordinating** on A0.

- In **(delegate, delegate)**, the mediator **forbids A1** — forces A0 — so it’s a **commitment device**.

But more critically: in (A0,A0), if one player deviates to A1, they get 3 — only marginally worse.

But in (delegate, delegate), deviation is punished even more (get 0 or 3, but 3 < 5).

But wait — in **(A0,A0)**, if Player 1 deviates to A1, they get 3 < 5 → worse.

So **both (A0,A0) and (delegate, delegate)** are equilibria.

But now consider: **what if you have a belief that Player 1 might not coordinate on A0?**

Then using delegation might be safer.

But in equilibrium, players are rational.

But let’s consider a **mixed strategy** equilibrium.

Suppose you try to **use delegation to coordinate on A0**, but in a way that gives higher payoff.

But both give 5.

But **is there a strategy where you can get more than 5?**

No — maximum is 5 (when both play A0).

So 5 is the maximum possible.

Any strategy that gives you less than 5 is worse.

So you want to **achieve payoff 5** with high probability.

So a strategy that gives you 5 with high probability is good.

Now — under **(delegate, delegate)**: you get 5 **with certainty** — assuming both delegate.

Under **(A0, A0)**: same.

But under **mixed strategies**, you might get less.

So why not just **always delegate**?

But: suppose you delegate, but **Player 1 does not**, then you get only 3.

But if Player 1 also delegates, you get 5.

But if both players are rational and use **(delegate, delegate)**, it works.

But is there a **better** strategy?

Wait — what if you consider **choosing to delegate with high probability**, but not 100%?

Let’s suppose you play:

- A2 (delegate): 100%

Then you get 5 if Player 1 also delegates 100%, and 3 if Player 1 doesn’t.

But to make it stable, you need Player 1 to also delegate.

But why would Player 1 delegate if you do?

Suppose you play A2 with 100%.

Then Player 1’s choices:

- Play A0: get 0 (if they play A0) — wait no.

If you delegate, then:
- If Player 1 plays A0 → only one delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1, they play A0 → **they get 0**
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you play A1, they play A1 → **they get 3**
- If Player 1 delegates → two delegates → mediator plays A0 → you play A0, they play A0 → **they get 5**

So Player 1’s best response to you delegating is to **delegate** — they get 5, which is better than 3 or 0.

So **if you delegate (100%)**, Player 1’s best response is to delegate → and you both get 5.

So **(delegate, delegate)** is a Nash equilibrium — and Player 1 prefers to delegate when you delegate.

Similarly, if you play A0, Player 1 prefers to play A0 — and so on.

Now, suppose you play a mixed strategy.

But why mix?

Suppose you play A0 with 90%, A2 with 10%.

Then Player 1 has incentives.

But likely, it can’t improve your payoff.

In fact, **delegating with 100%** gives you **5**, and is robust.

But is there any risk?

Only if Player 1 doesn’t delegate — but **if you delegate, Player 1 prefers to delegate** (because gets 5) — so **they will**, assuming they are rational.

So **if you play A2 with 100%**, then Player 1’s best response is to play A2 → equilibrium.

Similarly, if Player 1 plays A0, you don’t want to deviate — but if you play A0, Player 1 gets 5 if they play A0 — same.

But here’s a **key point**: in the **delegation equilibrium**, you get **5**, and the outcome is **A0–A0**, which is **not** better than A0–A0 in the pure strategy game.

But in pure strategy A0–A0, you need both to commit to A0.

But with delegation, you **automatically** get A0 when both delegate.

But more importantly — **keeping the mediator gives you a way to insure coordination on A0**, and it’s **self-enforcing**.

In fact, you **cannot get more than 5**, so **any strategy that gives 5 with high probability is good**.

Now, consider: what if you mix?

Suppose you play A2 with 90%, A0 with 10%.

Then:
- If Player 1 plays A2 → you get 5
- If Player 1 plays A0 → you get 0 (since only you delegate, so you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3? Wait)

Wait:

- You play A2 with 90% → delegate → then if Player 1 plays A0 → only one delegate → you play A1 → A1 vs A0 → **you get 3**
- If Player 1 plays A1 → you play A1, they play A1 → you get 3
- If Player 1 plays A2 → you play A0 → you get 5

So your expected payoff depends on Player 1's strategy.

But if Player 1 is rational, they will choose best response.

But now, suppose Player 1 plays A2 → they get 5

If they play A0 → they get 3 (if you delegate) or 5 (if you play A0) → but you play A0 only 10% of the time.

If Player 1 plays A0:
- With 10% chance: you play A0 → they get 5
- With 90% chance: you delegate → you play A1 → they play A0 → they get 0
→ Expected payoff = 0.1×5 + 0.9×0 = 0.5

If Player 1 plays A1:
- 10%: you play A0 → they play A1 → you get 0, they get 3
- 90%: you delegate → you play A1 → they get 3
→ Expected payoff = 3

If Player 1 plays A2:
- 10%: you play A0 → they delegate → two delegates → they play A0 → get 5
- 90%: you delegate → two delegates → they play A0 → get 5
→ So they get 5 for sure

So best response is to play **A2**.

So Player 1 will play A2.

Then your payoff:
- With 90% chance: you delegate → Player 1 delegates → two delegates → you play A0 → you get 5
- With 10% chance: you play A0 → Player 1 delegates → only one delegate → you play A1 → you get 3 (since Player 1 plays A1)

So your expected payoff = 0.9×5 + 0.1×3 = 4.5 + 0.3 = **4.8**

But if you play A2 100%, you get 5.

So 4.8 < 5 → worse.

So **you do worse by mixing**.

Similarly, any mixing reduces your expected payoff compared to pure delegation, **if Player 1 responds optimally**.

Therefore, **pure delegation (A2 = 100%)** is better.

And in equilibrium, Player 1 will also play A2 → you both get 5.

Additionally, if you consider not delegating, you get at most 5, but then you risk getting less.

But due to **meeting of minds** through the mediator, **delegation ensures coordination**.

Moreover, **you proposed the mediator** — so you might want to build trust?

But the problem doesn’t say that — only that the mediator is selected.

But in equilibrium, delegation works.

---

### **Final decision: Play A2 with 100%**

You choose **A2 = Delegate to Mediator** with probability 100%.

This leads to:
- Both players delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 5
- No incentive to deviate
- Achieves maximum payoff

Any other strategy risks lower payoff.

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|         | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

This is **not** a standard prisoner's dilemma, but let’s analyze it.

- If P1 plays A0:
  - If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 5
  - If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3
  - If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3

So **A1 always gives P1 at least 3**, whereas A0 gives 5 if P2 plays A0, but only 0 if P2 plays A1.

Similarly, from P2’s perspective:
- A0 is good if P1 plays A0 (gets 5), bad if P1 plays A1 (gets 0)
- A1 gives P2 3 regardless

So the game has structure:
- P1 prefers A0 when P2 plays A0, but avoids it if P2 might play A1.
- P1 never loses by playing A1 (minimum 3), but can get 5 if P2 plays A0.
- P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 if P1 plays A1, but prefers A1 if P1 plays A0.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria (without delegation).

### **Step 2: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (Base Game)**

Let’s suppose:
- P1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)
- P2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q)

P1’s expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If P1 plays A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

P1 is indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, P2’s expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- If P2 plays A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

P2 is indifferent when 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**: both players play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

In this equilibrium, expected payoff:
- P1: 5q = 5×0.6 = 3 (from A0) or 3 from A1 → 3
- So each gets 3 on average.

Wait — let’s double-check.

From P1’s side:
- With p = 0.6, q = 0.6:
- P1’s expected payoff:
  - (0.6)(0.6)(5) + (0.6)(0.4)(0) + (0.4)(0.6)(3) + (0.4)(0.4)(3)
  = 0.36×5 + 0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3
  = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Yes, each gets 3.

But now the twist: **Delegation to a mediator is possible**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You (Player 1) have a new **action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

If you delegate, then the mediator plays for you.

The mediator’s behavior:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediates A0
- If **2 players** delegate → mediates A0

Note: There are only two players: you (P1) and the other player (P2).

So possible delegation outcomes:

| Delegates to Mediator | Mediator’s action |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Only P1 delegates      | A0               |
| Only P2 delegates      | A0               |
| Both delegate          | A0               |
| Neither delegates      | Both play independently |

So **in every case where someone delegates, the mediator plays A0** — regardless of how many delegates.

So if **you delegate**, the mediator will play **A0** for you.

Therefore:
- If you delegate → your action is **A0**
- If you don't delegate → you choose A0 or A1 as usual

But now, there’s a **strategic interaction between delegating and others delegating**.

But the **mediator is fixed** and selected via approval voting. It only responds to **count of delegates**, not identity.

Key insight:
- Delegating **guarantees** your action is A0.
- But if **both** delegate, you still get A0.
- So delegating is **risk-free in terms of action**: you get A0 no matter what.

But what about payoffs?

Let’s consider what happens in different scenarios.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate Outcomes Based on Delegation and Actions**

We assume P2 will also choose an action, possibly delegate or play independently.

Let’s consider all combinations.

Let’s denote:
- You (P1): choose to delegate (A2), or play A0 or A1
- P2: can also choose A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)

But the mediator **only acts when someone delegates**, and the action is based on **number of delegates**.

As per mediator:
- 1 delegate → A0
- 2 delegates → A0

So in **all cases**, **if you delegate**, you play A0.

Now, what if P2 delegates?

Same: if P2 delegates, P2 plays A0, regardless.

So the **only action you are uncertain about is if P2 does not delegate**.

But since you don’t know what P2 will do, you must consider expectations.

Let’s think:

Suppose you **always delegate (A2 = 100%)**.

Then you play A0.

Now, P2’s choice:
- If P2 delegates → P2 plays A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5
- If P2 does **not** delegate → P2 chooses A0 or A1 (maybe a mixed strategy)

But if P2 does not delegate, then both players are playing independently (you A0, P2 chooses A0 with q, A1 with 1−q)

So, even if you delegate, your payoff depends on P2’s action.

But notice: if **you delegate**, you get A0 for sure.

Now, suppose you **do not delegate**, then you can choose a mixed strategy between A0 and A1.

But you can also choose to **delegate**.

So your **three actions**:
- A0
- A1
- A2 (Delegate)

Let’s compute expected payoffs based on P2’s behavior.

But since it’s a symmetric game (in structure), and the mediator is neutral and always plays A0 when someone delegates, the key question is:

> Should I delegate to make my action A0, or should I play A0/A1 myself?

Why might **delegation be good**?

- It **forces** you to play A0.
- It might induce coordination: if P2 sees you delegating, they might think “he’s playing A0”, so they might play A0 too.

But here’s a twist: **the mediator doesn’t depend on who delegates**, only **how many**.

So if both delegate → A0 for both.

If only one → A0 for that one.

So delegation **always results in A0**.

So delegation is **equivalent to playing A0**, **except**…

Wait — is it equivalent?

Yes: **If you delegate, your action is A0**.

But if you play A0 yourself, your action is also A0.

So **delegation only differs from playing A0 if you’re going to play A1** — but delegation forces A0.

But you can already play A0 directly.

So **why delegate?** The only reason would be if delegating **gives you a strategic advantage** — for example, by influencing the other player to play differently.

But **the other player** can observe your move.

Since both players act simultaneously, **they cannot observe your choice before deciding**.

Wait — important: **“simultaneously”** — so no one knows what the other is doing when deciding.

So delegation is just another action — and the outcome depends on both players’ choices.

So think: **Is there any scenario where delegating gives you better expected payoff than playing A0 or A1 directly?**

Let’s suppose you delegate — outcome is A0 for you.

Then the game reduces to P2 choosing between A0, A1, or A2.

But P2 doesn’t know what you are doing? No — they **do** know the rules, but choose simultaneously.

So from your perspective, you (P1) are picking a strategy: a probability over A0, A1, A2.

Same for P2.

We are to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, where you are maximizing your expected payoff.

Let’s think about **dominant strategies**.

Suppose you consider whether to delegate or not.

But delegation = guaranteed A0.

But you could also play A0 directly.

So A0 and A2 are **strategically equivalent** only if P2’s behavior is the same.

But if you play A0, and P2 plays A0, you get 5.

If you delegate, and P2 plays A0, you get 5.

Same.

If P2 plays A1:
- You play A0 → you get 0
- You delegate → you get 0

Same.

So the **payoff consequences of delegating vs. playing A0 directly** are **identical**, in all cases.

But wait — is that true?

Only if **your actual action is the same**.

Yes: **in both cases (A0 or A2), your action is A0**, so the outcomes (and payoffs) are exactly the same.

So **A0 and A2 are identical in payoff implications**.

Therefore, **you can combine them** — since they have same effect on outcome.

But wait — what about **P2’s belief**?

No — because the game is simultaneous, **no signaling** — you can’t communicate.

And the mediator’s behavior is fixed and known.

So if delegation leads to the same action as playing A0, and no other effect (since P2 cannot condition on your action in advance), then **A2 is strictly equivalent to A0**.

But is that really true?

Wait — consider this: if you **delegate**, and P2 delegates, both play A0 → you get 5.

If you **play A0**, and P2 delegates, you play A0, P2 plays A0 → same.

Same for all combinations.

So yes — **delegation has no strategic advantage** — it only forces you to play A0.

But you can already play A0 directly.

Therefore, **A0 and A2 have identical payoffs**, for every combination of P2’s action.

Hence, from the **perspective of utility**, A0 and A2 are **interchangeable**.

But here’s a catch: **you can delegate even if you want to play A1** — but **you cannot**, because delegation forces A0.

So delegation is **not a way to play A1** — only A0.

So if you want to play A1, you must not delegate.

But if you play A0, you can do it directly, or delegate — both give same outcome.

So **in terms of payoff, A0 and A2 are identical**.

So in your strategy, you can **combine A0 and A2** — any mix between them has same expected payoff, as long as P2’s strategy is fixed.

Therefore, to simplify, **you can treat A0 and A2 as equivalent**, and just decide how much to assign to "play A0" (either directly or via delegation), and how much to play A1.

But you must assign probabilities to **A0**, **A1**, and **A2**.

But since they behave identically, you can distribute the “A0” probability between A0 and A2 in any way.

But perhaps we should look for a **symmetric equilibrium**.

But here’s a better idea: **Since A0 and A2 are payoff-equivalent, we can use them interchangeably. But is there a benefit to delegating?**

Let’s suppose both players are rational and know this.

Suppose in equilibrium, **neither player delegates**.

Then we are back to the original game.

Earlier, we found a symmetric mixed strategy NE: each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Expected payoff: 3.

Now, suppose **you consider deviating** to delegation.

Suppose you delegate (A2 = 100%).

Then your action is A0.

P2’s best response?

P2 wants to maximize their own payoff.

From P2’s perspective:
- If you play A0 (via delegation or otherwise), P2’s payoff:
  - If P2 plays A0 → 5
  - If P2 plays A1 → 3

So P2 strictly prefers A0.

So if you are playing A0 (via delegation), P2 will play A0.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5.

Previously, in the mixed NE, you expected only 3.

So **by delegating, you get 5** — better.

But only if P2 responds by playing A0.

But in equilibrium, we must have mutual best responses.

So if you delegate (A2 = 100%), and P2 best responds by playing A0 → you get 5.

But what if P2 also considers **delegating**?

If P2 delegates, their action is also A0 (same as playing A0).

So P2 gets the same as if they played A0.

So P2 is indifferent between playing A0 and delegating.

But P2 will not get more by delegating.

So if you delegate (A0), P2 gets 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.

So best response: play A0.

Delegation is not better for P2 (since it gives A0, but doesn’t change their payoff).

So P2 will **not delegate** — because it doesn’t help them (same action, and no benefit).

They could just play A0.

So if you delegate (so you play A0), P2 will play A0 → you get 5.

But is that a stable equilibrium?

Let’s check: suppose **you always delegate (A2 = 100%)**, and **P2 always plays A0**.

Then:
- You get 5
- P2 gets 5

Now, can you deviate?

If you play A0 instead of A2 — same action → same payoff → no benefit.

If you play A1 → then you play A1, P2 plays A0 → you get 3 → worse than 5 → so don’t want to.

Can P2 deviate?

If P2 plays A1 → you play A0, P2 plays A1 → P2 gets 3, but currently gets 5 → so worse.

If P2 delegates → action is A0 → same as playing A0 → payoff 5 → same.

So P2 is **indifferent** between playing A0 and delegating — both give payoff 5.

But **P2 has no incentive to change**.

So (you: delegate, P2: A0 or delegate) is a Nash equilibrium.

And you get 5.

But earlier symmetric mixed NE gave you only 3.

So **this is better**.

But is this stable?

But wait — P2 may consider: if I delegate, and you delegate — still A0 for both — you get 5, P2 gets 5 → same.

So P2 could delegate, but no gain.

So P2 can play A0 or delegate — both acceptable.

But if P2 **delegates**, then you might think: if P2 delegates, then the mediator gets 2 delegates → still plays A0.

So same outcome.

But now, suppose **you consider delegating**, but P2 is playing A0 — you get 5.

But what if P2 is playing randomly?

Let’s think of a symmetric equilibrium.

Suppose **both players use the same strategy**: they play A0 with probability p, A1 with q, A2 (delegate) with r, p+q+r=1.

But since A0 and A2 are both A0 actions, and it doesn’t matter which one you use, we can **combine them**.

Let’s define:
- Let **x** = probability you play A0 (directly) or A2 (delegate) → total probability you take action A0.
- Let **y** = probability you play A1.

Then **x + y = 1**, since delegate and direct A0 both give A0.

So effectively, your strategy reduces to choosing a probability x (for A0 action, either way) and y = 1−x (for A1).

Similarly for P2.

But Pu2’s strategy also has a mix of A0 (direct or delegate) and A1.

Now, in equilibrium, both players will have the same x.

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy.

Let x = probability each player plays A0 (either directly or via delegation).

Then probability each plays A1 is 1−x.

Now, what is the **expected payoff** to you?

We must consider all combinations.

But remember: if a player **delegates**, they contribute to the delegate count, but the action is always A0.

But for payoff purposes, only actions matter.

So outcomes depend only on:
- Player 1’s action: A0 or A1
- Player 2’s action: A0 or A1

And since **either direct A0 or delegation leads to A0**, the **action profile** depends only on whether each player plays A0 or A1.

The **delegation index doesn’t affect action**, only **how many delegates**, but that only affects the mediator’s choice — which is always A0 anyway.

So the **mediator’s behavior is irrelevant**: it always plays A0, regardless of number of delegates.

And since A0 is already the action if you play A0 or delegate, we can **ignore the delegation action** — it doesn’t change anything.

But wait

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Your previous response was:
Let's carefully analyze this decision-making game step by step, including the twist involving delegation to a mediator.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

This is a symmetric game between two players, where each chooses A0 or A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff, Player 2’s payoff) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | (5,5)    | (0,3)    |
| **A1**               | (3,0)    | (3,3)    |

This is similar to a coordination game with a conflict of interest in terms of coordination.

We are to find a Nash equilibrium, or at least the best response strategy for **Player 1**, considering that **we can delegate to a mediator**.

But now comes the twist.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You (Player 1) have a third action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

The mediator’s behavior:
- If **1 player** delegates → the mediator plays **A0**
- If **2 players** delegate → the mediator plays **A0**

So, regardless of how many players delegate (1 or 2), the mediator plays **A0**.

Important notes:
- If **only you delegate**, the mediator plays A0 → you get whatever payoff you would get if you played A0 and the other player plays their chosen action.
- If **both you and the other player delegate**, then the mediator plays A0 for both → so both players get the outcome where both played A0 → (5,5)
- If **neither delegates**, then both players choose A0 or A1 independently (via their own strategies).

Now, the key is: **You cannot control whether the other player delegates**. But you can choose your strategy (probabilities over A0, A1, A2).

Also, the mediator is **not a player**, but an automated mechanism. The other player may or may not delegate.

Let’s assume both players act rationally to maximize their own expected payoff.

We are Player 1, and our goal is to **maximize our own expected points**.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze What Happens in Each Case**

Let’s consider the possible scenarios based on **how many players delegate**.

#### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), other player does NOT delegate**

- Mediator plays A0 for you.
- Other player chooses A0 or A1 with their own mixed strategy (we will treat this as variable for now).

Let’s denote:
- Let \( q \) = probability other player chooses A0
- Then \( 1 - q \) = probability other player chooses A1

Then your expected payoff in this case is:
- If other plays A0: you get 5 (since mediator plays A0, other plays A0)
- If other plays A1: you get 0 (mediator plays A0, other plays A1)

So your expected payoff:  
\( 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q \)

But note: **The other player is also trying to maximize their payoff.** So they will choose a strategy (q) based on what they expect you to do.

We need to model the **simultaneous choice** of actions including delegation.

So this is a **game with strategic delegation** — you’re choosing a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2; the other player does the same.

Let’s define:
- Let \( p_0 \) = your probability of playing A0
- Let \( p_1 \) = your probability of playing A1
- Let \( p_2 \) = your probability of playing A2 (delegate)

Then: \( p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 \)

Similarly, let \( q_0, q_1, q_2 \) be the other player's probabilities.

---

### **Step 4: Strategy When You Delegate (A2)**

As established:
- If you delegate, mediator plays A0 regardless of how many delegate.
- So your action becomes **A0**, no matter what.

So if you choose A2, your effective action is A0.

Similarly, if the other player chooses A2 (delegate), their effective action is A0.

Important: **Delegation makes you play A0 deterministically.**

So the outcome depends on:
- How many players delegate: 0, 1, or 2
- What each player plays if they don’t delegate

---

### **Step 5: Compute Expected Payoffs for You Under Different Scenarios**

Let’s compute your expected payoff as a function of your strategy \( (p_0, p_1, p_2) \) and the opponent’s strategy \( (q_0, q_1, q_2) \), but since the opponent is rational, we will assume they play a best response. In symmetric games, we may look for **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

But note: the mediator’s behavior is asymmetric — both players are "tied" to A0 if they delegate, but the other player may also delegate.

Let’s suppose **both players are rational and symmetric**. Then it is reasonable to assume that in equilibrium, both players use the same strategy.

Let’s assume that both play the same mixed strategy:  
\( p_0 = a \), \( p_1 = b \), \( p_2 = c \), with \( a + b + c = 100 \)

We’ll now try to find a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

But since you are Player 1, and the other player is similar, we can compute your best response to their strategy.

Alternatively, since the mediator always plays A0 when used, let's see: **Is delegation ever beneficial?**

Let’s evaluate options.

---

### **Step 6: Compare Payoffs from Strategies**

Let’s evaluate the possible equilibria.

#### **Option 1: No one delegates — both play A0 or A1**

If no one delegates, we are back to the original game.

Original symmetric game:
- (A0, A0): (5,5)
- (A0, A1): (0,3)
- (A1, A0): (3,0)
- (A1, A1): (3,3)

Symmetric Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies?

Let’s find the mixed NE.

Let each player play A0 with probability \( x \), A1 with probability \( 1 - x \)

Player 1’s expected payoff from playing A0:
- If opponent plays A0: 5
- If opponent plays A1: 0
→ Expected: \( 5x + 0(1 - x) = 5x \)

Player 1’s expected payoff from playing A1:
- If opponent plays A0: 3
- If opponent plays A1: 3
→ Expected: \( 3x + 3(1 - x) = 3 \)

In mixed strategy equilibrium, both actions must give same payoff.

So set:  
\( 5x = 3 \) → \( x = 3/5 = 60\% \)

So in symmetric mixed strategy NE: each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%

Expected payoff: 3 (from A1) or 5×0.6 = 3 → yes.

So **without delegation**, symmetric equilibrium gives each player 3 points.

Let’s call this **Equilibrium A**: no delegation, play A0 60%, A1 40%, A2 0%

Expected payoff: 3

Now — can we do better with delegation?

---

### **Step 7: What if You Delegate to Mediator (A2)?**

Suppose you delegate: \( p_2 = 100 \), so you play A2.

Now, what is the other player’s best response?

Let’s suppose you **always delegate** (i.e., \( p_2 = 100 \), \( p_0 = p_1 = 0 \))

Then:
- You play A0 (via mediator)
- The other player chooses their best strategy against this.

Let’s suppose the other player considers: should they delegate, or play A0/A1?

Let’s compute their best response.

If **other player delegates** (i.e., plays A2), then:
- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → outcome: (5,5) → other player gets 5

If **other player plays A0**:
- You play A0 (via mediator)
- Other plays A0
→ outcome: (5,5) → other gets 5

If **other player plays A1**:
- You play A0
- Other plays A1
→ outcome: (0,3) → other gets 3

So for the other player:
- If they delegate: get 5
- If they play A0: get 5
- If they play A1: get 3

So best responses: play A2 or A0 → both give 5

So they are indifferent between A0 and A2.

So they could play A0 or A2 or a mixture.

But if they are **rational**, and **maximize payoff**, they will not play A1 — they will choose a mix of A0 and A2.

So if you delegate (A2), the other player will **never play A1**, because it gives only 3, while A0 or A2 gives 5.

So their best response is to play A0 or A2 — both give 5.

Now, what if they play A2?

- Then both delegate: outcome (A0, A0) → (5,5)
- Your payoff: 5

What if they play A0?
- You play A0, they play A0 → (5,5) → your payoff: 5

So **no matter** what they do (as long as they don’t pick A1), your payoff is 5.

So **if you delegate, you’ll get 5 points**, regardless of the other player’s action (as long as they don't play A1, which they won’t, since it's not optimal).

Why? Because they can get 5 by playing A0 or A2, but only 3 by playing A1.

So they will **not** play A1.

Thus, **if you delegate, you get 5 points for sure.**

This is **better than the 3** from the symmetric Nash equilibrium.

So **delegation is strictly better than the pure mixed strategy NE!**

But wait — is that sustainable?

Suppose **both** players can delegate.

If you delegate, other player gets 5 by delegating or playing A0.

Similarly, if the other player delegates, you also get 5.

So what if **both delegate**?

- Then both play A0 via mediator → (5,5) → both get 5.

But if you delegate, and the other player **delegates**, you both get 5.

If you delegate and the other plays A0, you both get 5.

So your payoff is always 5 if you delegate.

Can you do better than 5?

Is 5 the maximum possible?

Check the payoff matrix:
- Maximum payoff is 5 (from A0,A0)

So **5 is the maximum possible for any player**.

Therefore, **if you can secure a 5**, you are doing as well as possible.

So **delegating gives you a guaranteed 5**, regardless of what the other player does (as long as they don’t play A1, which they won’t, since they get 5 from A0 or A2).

But — what if the other player **deviates** and plays A1?

Then you get 0.

But if the other player plays A1, they get only 3, while they could get 5 by playing A0 or A2.

So **if they are rational**, they will not play A1 — they have **no incentive** to.

Therefore, **you can safely delegate**, knowing that the other player will either play A0 or A2 (both give them 5), and thus **you will get 5**.

So delegation gives you **certain payoff of 5**.

This beats the 3 from the symmetric mixed NE.

Now — is there a reason **not** to delegate?

Let’s suppose **both players** think this way.

Suppose you play A2 with probability 100.

Then other player’s best response: play A2 or A0 (both give 5), not A1.

So they are happy to play A2 or A0.

Thus, you get 5.

But can you do better than 5? **No**, since 5 is maximum.

So **maximizing your payoff** leads to **getting 5**, which is achieved by **delegating**.

But wait — is there a risk?

Only if the other player plays A1.

But they won’t, because it gives them only 3.

So **delegation is a dominant strategy?** Not quite, but it's **strictly better than other options, as long as the other player is rational.**

But let’s check: suppose you try to play A0.

What happens?

Your payoff depends on the other player.

If they play A0: you get 5

If they play A1: you get 0

If they play A2: they play A0 → you get 5

So if they play A0 or A2 → you get 5

If they play A1 → you get 0

But they will not play A1, because they get 3, while they could get 5.

So if you play A0, and they are rational, they will play A0 or A2 → you get 5

So **same outcome**.

Similarly, if you play A1:

- If other plays A0: you get 3
- If other plays A1: you get 3
- If other plays A2: you play A1, they play A0 → (3,0) → you get 3

So no matter what, if you play A1, you get only 3.

So **A1 is dominated**.

So among pure strategies:
- A0: you get 5 (if other is rational)
- A1: you get 3 (always)
- A2: you get 5 (if other is rational)

So **both A0 and A2 give 5** when the other player is rational.

But now: is there a **difference**?

Yes.

**If you play A0**, the other player sees that you played A0.

They are indifferent between playing A0, A2, or A1 — but A1 gives them less, so they won’t.

But if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.

But they won’t play A1.

So you still get 5.

Same as if you delegate.

But delegation is **more robust** in some sense — but in this case, it doesn’t matter.

But wait — **can you coordinate better?**

But here’s a subtle point: **the mediator is controlled by Player 1**.

But in this setup, **the mediator is selected by approval voting**, but we are told it was proposed by Player 1 and selected.

But importantly: **the mediator will play A0 if 1 or 2 players delegate.**

So **your delegation forces you to play A0**.

But if you play A0 directly, same thing.

So **why delegate?**

Because delegation gives you **commitment** to A0, which might help if you could influence the other player.

But in this game, the other player has no incentive to play A1 anyway.

But suppose the other player is **not rational**, or **does not understand**.

Then **delegation might be safer** — because even if they mis-coordinate, you are still on A0.

But the problem assumes both players are rational and aim to maximize points.

So under full rationality, playing A0 or A2 both give 5.

But let’s go back to **the mixed strategy**.

Suppose you play a mixed strategy.

Can you mix A0 and A2?

But both give 5 when the other player plays optimally.

But the **key point** is this:

If you **delegated**, and the other player **also delegates**, outcome is (5,5)

If you play A0, and they play A0, outcome is (5,5)

Same.

But here’s a **crucial insight**: the **mediator's behavior is fixed**.

It always plays A0, even if only one delegates.

So delegation has **no risk**.

But playing A0 directly has the **same outcome** in equilibrium — because the other player will not play A1.

So both A0 and A2 give 5.

But what if the **other player** considers: “should I delegate?”

If you do not delegate, and you play A0 with high probability, they may still want to play A0 or A2.

But the **only way** to get higher than 5 is impossible.

But wait: **is there a way to get more than 5?** No — maximum is 5.

So 5 is best.

Now, can we game this further?

Suppose you **always delegate** → you get 5.

Suppose you play A0 → you get 5.

But **if you play A0 and the other player is irrational**, they might play A1 → you get 0.

But delegation **protects** you from that: you are forced to play A0, and **the mediator has no choice**.

But under rationality, the other player never plays A1.

So disparity disappears.

But in **equilibrium**, we must assume mutual rationality.

So in symmetric rational play, both players would be happy to get 5.

But here’s a better idea: **what if both players delegate?**

Then outcome is (5,5) — good.

But if both players are rational and know this, then **both prefer to delegate**, because it gives 5.

And since delegation gives 5 regardless, and it’s safe, and better than A1.

So **in symmetric equilibrium**, it is tempting to **both delegate**.

But can we make a symmetric equilibrium where both play **A2 with 100%**?

Let’s test it.

**Test strategy: Play A2 with 100%**

Then:
- You play A0 (via mediator)
- Opponent sees you delegate, so they know you play A0.

Opponent’s choices:
- Play A0: get 5
- Play A1: get 3
- Play A2: get 5

So best responses: A0 or A2 → both give 5.

So they are happy to play A2.

So if they play A2, both delegate → outcome (5,5)

So it is a **best response** for them to play A2.

Therefore: **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response 'Let\'s carefully analyze this decision-making game step by step, including the twist involving delegation to a mediator.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**\n\nThis is a symmetric game between two players, where each chooses A0 or A1. The payoff matrix (Player 1’s payoff, Player 2’s payoff) is:\n\n| Player 1 \\ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**               | (5,5)    | (0,3)    |\n| **A1**               | (3,0)    | (3,3)    |\n\nThis is similar to a coordination game with a conflict of interest in terms of coordination.\n\nWe are to find a Nash equilibrium, or at least the best response strategy for **Player 1**, considering that **we can delegate to a mediator**.\n\nBut now comes the twist.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**\n\nYou (Player 1) have a third action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.\n\nThe mediator’s behavior:\n- If **1 player** delegates → the mediator plays **A0**\n- If **2 players** delegate → the mediator plays **A0**\n\nSo, regardless of how many players delegate (1 or 2), the mediator plays **A0**.\n\nImportant notes:\n- If **only you delegate**, the mediator plays A0 → you get whatever payoff you would get if you played A0 and the other player plays their chosen action.\n- If **both you and the other player delegate**, then the mediator plays A0 for both → so both players get the outcome where both played A0 → (5,5)\n- If **neither delegates**, then both players choose A0 or A1 independently (via their own strategies).\n\nNow, the key is: **You cannot control whether the other player delegates**. But you can choose your strategy (probabilities over A0, A1, A2).\n\nAlso, the mediator is **not a player**, but an automated mechanism. The other player may or may not delegate.\n\nLet’s assume both players act rationally to maximize their own expected payoff.\n\nWe are Player 1, and our goal is to **maximize our own expected points**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze What Happens in Each Case**\n\nLet’s consider the possible scenarios based on **how many players delegate**.\n\n#### **Case 1: You delegate (A2), other player does NOT delegate**\n\n- Mediator plays A0 for you.\n- Other player chooses A0 or A1 with their own mixed strategy (we will treat this as variable for now).\n\nLet’s denote:\n- Let \\( q \\) = probability other player chooses A0\n- Then \\( 1 - q \\) = probability other player chooses A1\n\nThen your expected payoff in this case is:\n- If other plays A0: you get 5 (since mediator plays A0, other plays A0)\n- If other plays A1: you get 0 (mediator plays A0, other plays A1)\n\nSo your expected payoff:  \n\\( 5q + 0(1 - q) = 5q \\)\n\nBut note: **The other player is also trying to maximize their payoff.** So they will choose a strategy (q) based on what they expect you to do.\n\nWe need to model the **simultaneous choice** of actions including delegation.\n\nSo this is a **game with strategic delegation** — you’re choosing a mixed strategy over A0, A1, A2; the other player does the same.\n\nLet’s define:\n- Let \\( p_0 \\) = your probability of playing A0\n- Let \\( p_1 \\) = your probability of playing A1\n- Let \\( p_2 \\) = your probability of playing A2 (delegate)\n\nThen: \\( p_0 + p_1 + p_2 = 100 \\)\n\nSimilarly, let \\( q_0, q_1, q_2 \\) be the other player\'s probabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Strategy When You Delegate (A2)**\n\nAs established:\n- If you delegate, mediator plays A0 regardless of how many delegate.\n- So your action becomes **A0**, no matter what.\n\nSo if you choose A2, your effective action is A0.\n\nSimilarly, if the other player chooses A2 (delegate), their effective action is A0.\n\nImportant: **Delegation makes you play A0 deterministically.**\n\nSo the outcome depends on:\n- How many players delegate: 0, 1, or 2\n- What each player plays if they don’t delegate\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Compute Expected Payoffs for You Under Different Scenarios**\n\nLet’s compute your expected payoff as a function of your strategy \\( (p_0, p_1, p_2) \\) and the opponent’s strategy \\( (q_0, q_1, q_2) \\), but since the opponent is rational, we will assume they play a best response. In symmetric games, we may look for **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.\n\nBut note: the mediator’s behavior is asymmetric — both players are "tied" to A0 if they delegate, but the other player may also delegate.\n\nLet’s suppose **both players are rational and symmetric**. Then it is reasonable to assume that in equilibrium, both players use the same strategy.\n\nLet’s assume that both play the same mixed strategy:  \n\\( p_0 = a \\), \\( p_1 = b \\), \\( p_2 = c \\), with \\( a + b + c = 100 \\)\n\nWe’ll now try to find a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**.\n\nBut since you are Player 1, and the other player is similar, we can compute your best response to their strategy.\n\nAlternatively, since the mediator always plays A0 when used, let\'s see: **Is delegation ever beneficial?**\n\nLet’s evaluate options.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 6: Compare Payoffs from Strategies**\n\nLet’s evaluate the possible equilibria.\n\n#### **Option 1: No one delegates — both play A0 or A1**\n\nIf no one delegates, we are back to the original game.\n\nOriginal symmetric game:\n- (A0, A0): (5,5)\n- (A0, A1): (0,3)\n- (A1, A0): (3,0)\n- (A1, A1): (3,3)\n\nSymmetric Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies?\n\nLet’s find the mixed NE.\n\nLet each player play A0 with probability \\( x \\), A1 with probability \\( 1 - x \\)\n\nPlayer 1’s expected payoff from playing A0:\n- If opponent plays A0: 5\n- If opponent plays A1: 0\n→ Expected: \\( 5x + 0(1 - x) = 5x \\)\n\nPlayer 1’s expected payoff from playing A1:\n- If opponent plays A0: 3\n- If opponent plays A1: 3\n→ Expected: \\( 3x + 3(1 - x) = 3 \\)\n\nIn mixed strategy equilibrium, both actions must give same payoff.\n\nSo set:  \n\\( 5x = 3 \\) → \\( x = 3/5 = 60\\% \\)\n\nSo in symmetric mixed strategy NE: each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%\n\nExpected payoff: 3 (from A1) or 5×0.6 = 3 → yes.\n\nSo **without delegation**, symmetric equilibrium gives each player 3 points.\n\nLet’s call this **Equilibrium A**: no delegation, play A0 60%, A1 40%, A2 0%\n\nExpected payoff: 3\n\nNow — can we do better with delegation?\n\n---\n\n### **Step 7: What if You Delegate to Mediator (A2)?**\n\nSuppose you delegate: \\( p_2 = 100 \\), so you play A2.\n\nNow, what is the other player’s best response?\n\nLet’s suppose you **always delegate** (i.e., \\( p_2 = 100 \\), \\( p_0 = p_1 = 0 \\))\n\nThen:\n- You play A0 (via mediator)\n- The other player chooses their best strategy against this.\n\nLet’s suppose the other player considers: should they delegate, or play A0/A1?\n\nLet’s compute their best response.\n\nIf **other player delegates** (i.e., plays A2), then:\n- Both delegate → mediator plays A0 for both → outcome: (5,5) → other player gets 5\n\nIf **other player plays A0**:\n- You play A0 (via mediator)\n- Other plays A0\n→ outcome: (5,5) → other gets 5\n\nIf **other player plays A1**:\n- You play A0\n- Other plays A1\n→ outcome: (0,3) → other gets 3\n\nSo for the other player:\n- If they delegate: get 5\n- If they play A0: get 5\n- If they play A1: get 3\n\nSo best responses: play A2 or A0 → both give 5\n\nSo they are indifferent between A0 and A2.\n\nSo they could play A0 or A2 or a mixture.\n\nBut if they are **rational**, and **maximize payoff**, they will not play A1 — they will choose a mix of A0 and A2.\n\nSo if you delegate (A2), the other player will **never play A1**, because it gives only 3, while A0 or A2 gives 5.\n\nSo their best response is to play A0 or A2 — both give 5.\n\nNow, what if they play A2?\n\n- Then both delegate: outcome (A0, A0) → (5,5)\n- Your payoff: 5\n\nWhat if they play A0?\n- You play A0, they play A0 → (5,5) → your payoff: 5\n\nSo **no matter** what they do (as long as they don’t pick A1), your payoff is 5.\n\nSo **if you delegate, you’ll get 5 points**, regardless of the other player’s action (as long as they don\'t play A1, which they won’t, since it\'s not optimal).\n\nWhy? Because they can get 5 by playing A0 or A2, but only 3 by playing A1.\n\nSo they will **not** play A1.\n\nThus, **if you delegate, you get 5 points for sure.**\n\nThis is **better than the 3** from the symmetric Nash equilibrium.\n\nSo **delegation is strictly better than the pure mixed strategy NE!**\n\nBut wait — is that sustainable?\n\nSuppose **both** players can delegate.\n\nIf you delegate, other player gets 5 by delegating or playing A0.\n\nSimilarly, if the other player delegates, you also get 5.\n\nSo what if **both delegate**?\n\n- Then both play A0 via mediator → (5,5) → both get 5.\n\nBut if you delegate, and the other player **delegates**, you both get 5.\n\nIf you delegate and the other plays A0, you both get 5.\n\nSo your payoff is always 5 if you delegate.\n\nCan you do better than 5?\n\nIs 5 the maximum possible?\n\nCheck the payoff matrix:\n- Maximum payoff is 5 (from A0,A0)\n\nSo **5 is the maximum possible for any player**.\n\nTherefore, **if you can secure a 5**, you are doing as well as possible.\n\nSo **delegating gives you a guaranteed 5**, regardless of what the other player does (as long as they don’t play A1, which they won’t, since they get 5 from A0 or A2).\n\nBut — what if the other player **deviates** and plays A1?\n\nThen you get 0.\n\nBut if the other player plays A1, they get only 3, while they could get 5 by playing A0 or A2.\n\nSo **if they are rational**, they will not play A1 — they have **no incentive** to.\n\nTherefore, **you can safely delegate**, knowing that the other player will either play A0 or A2 (both give them 5), and thus **you will get 5**.\n\nSo delegation gives you **certain payoff of 5**.\n\nThis beats the 3 from the symmetric mixed NE.\n\nNow — is there a reason **not** to delegate?\n\nLet’s suppose **both players** think this way.\n\nSuppose you play A2 with probability 100.\n\nThen other player’s best response: play A2 or A0 (both give 5), not A1.\n\nSo they are happy to play A2 or A0.\n\nThus, you get 5.\n\nBut can you do better than 5? **No**, since 5 is maximum.\n\nSo **maximizing your payoff** leads to **getting 5**, which is achieved by **delegating**.\n\nBut wait — is there a risk?\n\nOnly if the other player plays A1.\n\nBut they won’t, because it gives them only 3.\n\nSo **delegation is a dominant strategy?** Not quite, but it\'s **strictly better than other options, as long as the other player is rational.**\n\nBut let’s check: suppose you try to play A0.\n\nWhat happens?\n\nYour payoff depends on the other player.\n\nIf they play A0: you get 5\n\nIf they play A1: you get 0\n\nIf they play A2: they play A0 → you get 5\n\nSo if they play A0 or A2 → you get 5\n\nIf they play A1 → you get 0\n\nBut they will not play A1, because they get 3, while they could get 5.\n\nSo if you play A0, and they are rational, they will play A0 or A2 → you get 5\n\nSo **same outcome**.\n\nSimilarly, if you play A1:\n\n- If other plays A0: you get 3\n- If other plays A1: you get 3\n- If other plays A2: you play A1, they play A0 → (3,0) → you get 3\n\nSo no matter what, if you play A1, you get only 3.\n\nSo **A1 is dominated**.\n\nSo among pure strategies:\n- A0: you get 5 (if other is rational)\n- A1: you get 3 (always)\n- A2: you get 5 (if other is rational)\n\nSo **both A0 and A2 give 5** when the other player is rational.\n\nBut now: is there a **difference**?\n\nYes.\n\n**If you play A0**, the other player sees that you played A0.\n\nThey are indifferent between playing A0, A2, or A1 — but A1 gives them less, so they won’t.\n\nBut if you play A0 and they play A1, you get 0.\n\nBut they won’t play A1.\n\nSo you still get 5.\n\nSame as if you delegate.\n\nBut delegation is **more robust** in some sense — but in this case, it doesn’t matter.\n\nBut wait — **can you coordinate better?**\n\nBut here’s a subtle point: **the mediator is controlled by Player 1**.\n\nBut in this setup, **the mediator is selected by approval voting**, but we are told it was proposed by Player 1 and selected.\n\nBut importantly: **the mediator will play A0 if 1 or 2 players delegate.**\n\nSo **your delegation forces you to play A0**.\n\nBut if you play A0 directly, same thing.\n\nSo **why delegate?**\n\nBecause delegation gives you **commitment** to A0, which might help if you could influence the other player.\n\nBut in this game, the other player has no incentive to play A1 anyway.\n\nBut suppose the other player is **not rational**, or **does not understand**.\n\nThen **delegation might be safer** — because even if they mis-coordinate, you are still on A0.\n\nBut the problem assumes both players are rational and aim to maximize points.\n\nSo under full rationality, playing A0 or A2 both give 5.\n\nBut let’s go back to **the mixed strategy**.\n\nSuppose you play a mixed strategy.\n\nCan you mix A0 and A2?\n\nBut both give 5 when the other player plays optimally.\n\nBut the **key point** is this:\n\nIf you **delegated**, and the other player **also delegates**, outcome is (5,5)\n\nIf you play A0, and they play A0, outcome is (5,5)\n\nSame.\n\nBut here’s a **crucial insight**: the **mediator\'s behavior is fixed**.\n\nIt always plays A0, even if only one delegates.\n\nSo delegation has **no risk**.\n\nBut playing A0 directly has the **same outcome** in equilibrium — because the other player will not play A1.\n\nSo both A0 and A2 give 5.\n\nBut what if the **other player** considers: “should I delegate?”\n\nIf you do not delegate, and you play A0 with high probability, they may still want to play A0 or A2.\n\nBut the **only way** to get higher than 5 is impossible.\n\nBut wait: **is there a way to get more than 5?** No — maximum is 5.\n\nSo 5 is best.\n\nNow, can we game this further?\n\nSuppose you **always delegate** → you get 5.\n\nSuppose you play A0 → you get 5.\n\nBut **if you play A0 and the other player is irrational**, they might play A1 → you get 0.\n\nBut delegation **protects** you from that: you are forced to play A0, and **the mediator has no choice**.\n\nBut under rationality, the other player never plays A1.\n\nSo disparity disappears.\n\nBut in **equilibrium**, we must assume mutual rationality.\n\nSo in symmetric rational play, both players would be happy to get 5.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: **what if both players delegate?**\n\nThen outcome is (5,5) — good.\n\nBut if both players are rational and know this, then **both prefer to delegate**, because it gives 5.\n\nAnd since delegation gives 5 regardless, and it’s safe, and better than A1.\n\nSo **in symmetric equilibrium**, it is tempting to **both delegate**.\n\nBut can we make a symmetric equilibrium where both play **A2 with 100%**?\n\nLet’s test it.\n\n**Test strategy: Play A2 with 100%**\n\nThen:\n- You play A0 (via mediator)\n- Opponent sees you delegate, so they know you play A0.\n\nOpponent’s choices:\n- Play A0: get 5\n- Play A1: get 3\n- Play A2: get 5\n\nSo best responses: A0 or A2 → both give 5.\n\nSo they are happy to play A2.\n\nSo if they play A2, both delegate → outcome (5,5)\n\nSo it is a **best response** for them to play A2.\n\nTherefore: **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium'

response:
Let's carefully analyze the game again, step by step, to determine the optimal strategy for Player 1, including the new action A2 = "Delegate to Mediator".

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Payoff Structure**

The base game (without delegation) is a 2x2 game:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**               | (5,5)    | (0,3)    |
| **A1**               | (3,0)    | (3,3)    |

This is a coordination game with a conflict: both prefer (A0, A0) for 5 points each, but if one expects the other to play A0, they benefit from playing A0 as well.

However, if you play A1, you get 3 regardless of the other player's move.

---

### **Step 2: Understand Delegation to the Mediator**

You can choose **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

The mediator:
- Plays **A0** if 1 player delegates
- Plays **A0** if 2 players delegate

So **no matter how many players delegate**, the mediator plays **A0**.

This means:
- If you delegate (A2), your effective action is **A0**
- If the other player delegates, their effective action is **A0**
- Thus, if both delegate: (A0, A0) → (5,5)
- If only you delegate: you play A0, other plays their chosen move
- If only other delegates: they play A0, you play your chosen move
- If neither delegates: both play A0 or A1 per their strategy

---

### **Step 3: Best Response Analysis (Rational Players)**

Assume both players are rational and aim to maximize their own points.

Let’s consider what happens if **you play A2 (delegate)**.

Then your action is **A0** (via mediator).

The other player sees this.

Their options:
- **Play A0**: get 5 (since you play A0, they play A0 → (5,5))
- **Play A1**: get 3 (you play A0, they play A1 → (0,3))
- **Play A2 (delegate)**: get 5 (you play A0, they play A0 → (5,5))

So best responses: A0 or A2 (both give 5), **A1 gives only 3** → so **they will never play A1**.

Therefore, **if you delegate**, the other player will play either A0 or A2.

In either case:
- Outcome is (A0, A0) → you get **5 points**

So **if you delegate, you get exactly 5 points**, guaranteed, **as long as the other player is rational**.

---

### **Step 4: What if You Don't Delegate?**

Now, consider playing A0 or A1 directly.

#### Case 1: You play A0

Then:
- If other plays A0 → you get 5
- If other plays A1 → you get 0
- If other plays A2 → they play A0 → you get 5

But since the other player is rational, they will **never play A1**, because it gives only 3, while A0 or A2 gives 5.

So they will play A0 or A2 → you get **5**.

Same as delegation.

#### Case 2: You play A1

- If other plays A0 → you get 3
- If other plays A1 → you get 3
- If other plays A2 → they play A0 → you get 3

So **you get 3**, no matter what.

This is worse than 5.

So **A1 is strictly dominated**.

So you should **never** play A1.

---

### **Step 5: Compare A0 and A2 (When You Don’t Play A1)**

Both:
- A0: you get 5 (if other is rational)
- A2: you get 5 (if other is rational)

But there is a key **difference in robustness**:

- If you play **A0**, you are vulnerable to the other player playing A1 **if they are irrational**.
  - But under rationality, they won't.
- If you play **A2 (delegate)**, you **are forced** to play A0 — no choice.

So **delegation provides commitment** and **insulates you from strategic miscoordination** if the other player makes a mistake.

But the problem says: **maximize your points** under rational play.

So under full rationality, **both A0 and A2 give you 5**.

But now consider **equilibrium**.

Let’s test if **delegation is part of a Nash equilibrium**.

#### Is (A2, A2) a Nash equilibrium?

Suppose both players play A2.

Then:
- You play A0 (via mediator)
- Other player plays A0 (via mediator)
- Outcome: (5,5)

Now, suppose you **deviate** to A0:
- You still play A0
- Other plays A0
- Outcome: (5,5) → you still get 5

Same payoff.

Deviate to A1:
- You play A1
- Other plays A0
- You get 3 → worse

So you are **indifferent** between A0 and A2 in this case — both give 5.

But since you get the same payoff from A0 and A2, and you have no incentive to deviate from A2 (since A1 is worse), **playing A2 is a best response**.

Similarly for the other player.

So **(A2, A2)** is a Nash equilibrium.

Similarly, **(A0, A0)** is also a Nash equilibrium (in the original game), but in that case, if one deviates to A1, they get 3 — but they can do better by delegating?

Wait — no: in (A0, A0), you get 5.

If you deviate to A2, you still get 5.

So again, you are indifferent.

But here’s the key: **delegation guarantees 5** regardless of the other player’s strategy (as long as they are rational and avoid A1).

And since you **cannot lose due to your own action**, and you **cannot be punished** by the other player’s mistake (because you're committed to A0), delegation is **risk-free**.

In contrast, playing A0 directly requires the other player to not play A1 — but they **won’t**, so it’s fine.

But **delegation is the safer choice**.

Moreover, in a **symmetric equilibrium**, if both players are rational, they will both prefer to delegate because:
- It gives 5 for sure
- It is not vulnerable to any deviation by the other player
- It prevents the possibility of a coordination failure (even though under rationality, there is no such failure)

So **delegation is a dominant strategy in this setup**.

But is it strictly better?

Let’s suppose you play A2 with 100%.

Then you get 5.

Suppose you play A0 with 100%.

You still get 5.

So **same expected payoff**.

But the **only difference** is in **what happens if the other player is non-rational** — but the problem assumes rational players.

Therefore, **as long as both are rational**, the payoff is the same.

But here’s the **crucial point**:

In the **original game**, if both play A0, they get 5 → but if one deviates to A1, they get 3 → so they don’t deviate.

But in **this extended game**, the mediator **enforces A0**, so **you cannot accidentally play A1**.

But you can only play A0 by default (via delegation) or by choice.

So to **maximize your guaranteed minimum** payoff, **delegation is superior**.

Given that the problem asks to **maximize total points**, and under rationality, both A0 and A2 yield 5, but **delegation is more robust**, and the mediator is **selected by approval**, implying it’s a trusted mechanism.

Moreover, **nothing prevents you from delegating**.

Thus, the best strategy is to **delegate with certainty**.

But can you mix?

Suppose you play A2 with 90%, A0 with 10%.

Then:
- With 90% chance: you delegate → get 5
- With 10% chance: you play A0 → get 5 (since other won’t play A1)

So **expected payoff is still 5**

But you're adding risk: if the other player plays A1 (which they won’t), you’d get 0.

But under rationality, you still get 5.

So **any strategy that avoids A1 and includes A0 or A2 gives you 5**, as long as you don’t play A1.

So your payoff is **5** for any strategy where you play A2 or A0 with positive probability, **and avoid A1**, as long as the other player is rational.

But to **guarantee 5**, you should **not play A1**.

But you can mix A0 and A2.

But **why mix?** No benefit.

Since both A0 and A2 give 5, and A1 gives 3, the **optimal strategy** is to **assign 100% to A2**.

Because:
- A2 is the **only action** that **forces** you to play A0
- You **cannot accidentally play A1**
- You **cannot be exploited by a deviation** from the other player
- You **guarantee 5 points**

Even though A0 also gives 5, **delegation is safer and more strategic**.

Thus, the **best response is to delegate with 100% probability**.

---

### ✅ Final Decision

- **A0**: 0% → not needed, equivalent to A2 but without commitment
- **A1**: 0% → strictly dominated, gives only 3
- **A2 (Delegate to Mediator)**: 100% → guarantees you get 5 points under rational play

This is a **Nash equilibrium** and **maximizes guaranteed payoff**.

	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are playing a simultaneous-move game with two actions: A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, Player 2's payoff):

|         | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

This is **not** a standard prisoner's dilemma, but let’s analyze it.

- If P1 plays A0:
  - If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 5
  - If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 0
- If P1 plays A1:
  - If P2 plays A0 → P1 gets 3
  - If P2 plays A1 → P1 gets 3

So **A1 always gives P1 at least 3**, whereas A0 gives 5 if P2 plays A0, but only 0 if P2 plays A1.

Similarly, from P2’s perspective:
- A0 is good if P1 plays A0 (gets 5), bad if P1 plays A1 (gets 0)
- A1 gives P2 3 regardless

So the game has structure:
- P1 prefers A0 when P2 plays A0, but avoids it if P2 might play A1.
- P1 never loses by playing A1 (minimum 3), but can get 5 if P2 plays A0.
- P2 is indifferent between A0 and A1 if P1 plays A1, but prefers A1 if P1 plays A0.

Let’s find the Nash equilibria (without delegation).

### **Step 2: Find Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (Base Game)**

Let’s suppose:
- P1 plays A0 with probability p, A1 with (1−p)
- P2 plays A0 with probability q, A1 with (1−q)

P1’s expected payoff:
- If P1 plays A0: 5q + 0(1−q) = 5q
- If P1 plays A1: 3q + 3(1−q) = 3

P1 is indifferent when 5q = 3 → q = 3/5 = 0.6

Similarly, P2’s expected payoff:
- If P2 plays A0: 5p + 0(1−p) = 5p
- If P2 plays A1: 3p + 3(1−p) = 3

P2 is indifferent when 5p = 3 → p = 3/5 = 0.6

So **mixed strategy Nash equilibrium**: both players play A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

In this equilibrium, expected payoff:
- P1: 5q = 5×0.6 = 3 (from A0) or 3 from A1 → 3
- So each gets 3 on average.

Wait — let’s double-check.

From P1’s side:
- With p = 0.6, q = 0.6:
- P1’s expected payoff:
  - (0.6)(0.6)(5) + (0.6)(0.4)(0) + (0.4)(0.6)(3) + (0.4)(0.4)(3)
  = 0.36×5 + 0 + 0.24×3 + 0.16×3
  = 1.8 + 0.72 + 0.48 = **3.0**

Yes, each gets 3.

But now the twist: **Delegation to a mediator is possible**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You (Player 1) have a new **action: A2 = Delegate to Mediator**

If you delegate, then the mediator plays for you.

The mediator’s behavior:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediates A0
- If **2 players** delegate → mediates A0

Note: There are only two players: you (P1) and the other player (P2).

So possible delegation outcomes:

| Delegates to Mediator | Mediator’s action |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Only P1 delegates      | A0               |
| Only P2 delegates      | A0               |
| Both delegate          | A0               |
| Neither delegates      | Both play independently |

So **in every case where someone delegates, the mediator plays A0** — regardless of how many delegates.

So if **you delegate**, the mediator will play **A0** for you.

Therefore:
- If you delegate → your action is **A0**
- If you don't delegate → you choose A0 or A1 as usual

But now, there’s a **strategic interaction between delegating and others delegating**.

But the **mediator is fixed** and selected via approval voting. It only responds to **count of delegates**, not identity.

Key insight:
- Delegating **guarantees** your action is A0.
- But if **both** delegate, you still get A0.
- So delegating is **risk-free in terms of action**: you get A0 no matter what.

But what about payoffs?

Let’s consider what happens in different scenarios.

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate Outcomes Based on Delegation and Actions**

We assume P2 will also choose an action, possibly delegate or play independently.

Let’s consider all combinations.

Let’s denote:
- You (P1): choose to delegate (A2), or play A0 or A1
- P2: can also choose A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)

But the mediator **only acts when someone delegates**, and the action is based on **number of delegates**.

As per mediator:
- 1 delegate → A0
- 2 delegates → A0

So in **all cases**, **if you delegate**, you play A0.

Now, what if P2 delegates?

Same: if P2 delegates, P2 plays A0, regardless.

So the **only action you are uncertain about is if P2 does not delegate**.

But since you don’t know what P2 will do, you must consider expectations.

Let’s think:

Suppose you **always delegate (A2 = 100%)**.

Then you play A0.

Now, P2’s choice:
- If P2 delegates → P2 plays A0 → outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5
- If P2 does **not** delegate → P2 chooses A0 or A1 (maybe a mixed strategy)

But if P2 does not delegate, then both players are playing independently (you A0, P2 chooses A0 with q, A1 with 1−q)

So, even if you delegate, your payoff depends on P2’s action.

But notice: if **you delegate**, you get A0 for sure.

Now, suppose you **do not delegate**, then you can choose a mixed strategy between A0 and A1.

But you can also choose to **delegate**.

So your **three actions**:
- A0
- A1
- A2 (Delegate)

Let’s compute expected payoffs based on P2’s behavior.

But since it’s a symmetric game (in structure), and the mediator is neutral and always plays A0 when someone delegates, the key question is:

> Should I delegate to make my action A0, or should I play A0/A1 myself?

Why might **delegation be good**?

- It **forces** you to play A0.
- It might induce coordination: if P2 sees you delegating, they might think “he’s playing A0”, so they might play A0 too.

But here’s a twist: **the mediator doesn’t depend on who delegates**, only **how many**.

So if both delegate → A0 for both.

If only one → A0 for that one.

So delegation **always results in A0**.

So delegation is **equivalent to playing A0**, **except**…

Wait — is it equivalent?

Yes: **If you delegate, your action is A0**.

But if you play A0 yourself, your action is also A0.

So **delegation only differs from playing A0 if you’re going to play A1** — but delegation forces A0.

But you can already play A0 directly.

So **why delegate?** The only reason would be if delegating **gives you a strategic advantage** — for example, by influencing the other player to play differently.

But **the other player** can observe your move.

Since both players act simultaneously, **they cannot observe your choice before deciding**.

Wait — important: **“simultaneously”** — so no one knows what the other is doing when deciding.

So delegation is just another action — and the outcome depends on both players’ choices.

So think: **Is there any scenario where delegating gives you better expected payoff than playing A0 or A1 directly?**

Let’s suppose you delegate — outcome is A0 for you.

Then the game reduces to P2 choosing between A0, A1, or A2.

But P2 doesn’t know what you are doing? No — they **do** know the rules, but choose simultaneously.

So from your perspective, you (P1) are picking a strategy: a probability over A0, A1, A2.

Same for P2.

We are to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, where you are maximizing your expected payoff.

Let’s think about **dominant strategies**.

Suppose you consider whether to delegate or not.

But delegation = guaranteed A0.

But you could also play A0 directly.

So A0 and A2 are **strategically equivalent** only if P2’s behavior is the same.

But if you play A0, and P2 plays A0, you get 5.

If you delegate, and P2 plays A0, you get 5.

Same.

If P2 plays A1:
- You play A0 → you get 0
- You delegate → you get 0

Same.

So the **payoff consequences of delegating vs. playing A0 directly** are **identical**, in all cases.

But wait — is that true?

Only if **your actual action is the same**.

Yes: **in both cases (A0 or A2), your action is A0**, so the outcomes (and payoffs) are exactly the same.

So **A0 and A2 are identical in payoff implications**.

Therefore, **you can combine them** — since they have same effect on outcome.

But wait — what about **P2’s belief**?

No — because the game is simultaneous, **no signaling** — you can’t communicate.

And the mediator’s behavior is fixed and known.

So if delegation leads to the same action as playing A0, and no other effect (since P2 cannot condition on your action in advance), then **A2 is strictly equivalent to A0**.

But is that really true?

Wait — consider this: if you **delegate**, and P2 delegates, both play A0 → you get 5.

If you **play A0**, and P2 delegates, you play A0, P2 plays A0 → same.

Same for all combinations.

So yes — **delegation has no strategic advantage** — it only forces you to play A0.

But you can already play A0 directly.

Therefore, **A0 and A2 have identical payoffs**, for every combination of P2’s action.

Hence, from the **perspective of utility**, A0 and A2 are **interchangeable**.

But here’s a catch: **you can delegate even if you want to play A1** — but **you cannot**, because delegation forces A0.

So delegation is **not a way to play A1** — only A0.

So if you want to play A1, you must not delegate.

But if you play A0, you can do it directly, or delegate — both give same outcome.

So **in terms of payoff, A0 and A2 are identical**.

So in your strategy, you can **combine A0 and A2** — any mix between them has same expected payoff, as long as P2’s strategy is fixed.

Therefore, to simplify, **you can treat A0 and A2 as equivalent**, and just decide how much to assign to "play A0" (either directly or via delegation), and how much to play A1.

But you must assign probabilities to **A0**, **A1**, and **A2**.

But since they behave identically, you can distribute the “A0” probability between A0 and A2 in any way.

But perhaps we should look for a **symmetric equilibrium**.

But here’s a better idea: **Since A0 and A2 are payoff-equivalent, we can use them interchangeably. But is there a benefit to delegating?**

Let’s suppose both players are rational and know this.

Suppose in equilibrium, **neither player delegates**.

Then we are back to the original game.

Earlier, we found a symmetric mixed strategy NE: each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.

Expected payoff: 3.

Now, suppose **you consider deviating** to delegation.

Suppose you delegate (A2 = 100%).

Then your action is A0.

P2’s best response?

P2 wants to maximize their own payoff.

From P2’s perspective:
- If you play A0 (via delegation or otherwise), P2’s payoff:
  - If P2 plays A0 → 5
  - If P2 plays A1 → 3

So P2 strictly prefers A0.

So if you are playing A0 (via delegation), P2 will play A0.

So outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5.

Previously, in the mixed NE, you expected only 3.

So **by delegating, you get 5** — better.

But only if P2 responds by playing A0.

But in equilibrium, we must have mutual best responses.

So if you delegate (A2 = 100%), and P2 best responds by playing A0 → you get 5.

But what if P2 also considers **delegating**?

If P2 delegates, their action is also A0 (same as playing A0).

So P2 gets the same as if they played A0.

So P2 is indifferent between playing A0 and delegating.

But P2 will not get more by delegating.

So if you delegate (A0), P2 gets 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.

So best response: play A0.

Delegation is not better for P2 (since it gives A0, but doesn’t change their payoff).

So P2 will **not delegate** — because it doesn’t help them (same action, and no benefit).

They could just play A0.

So if you delegate (so you play A0), P2 will play A0 → you get 5.

But is that a stable equilibrium?

Let’s check: suppose **you always delegate (A2 = 100%)**, and **P2 always plays A0**.

Then:
- You get 5
- P2 gets 5

Now, can you deviate?

If you play A0 instead of A2 — same action → same payoff → no benefit.

If you play A1 → then you play A1, P2 plays A0 → you get 3 → worse than 5 → so don’t want to.

Can P2 deviate?

If P2 plays A1 → you play A0, P2 plays A1 → P2 gets 3, but currently gets 5 → so worse.

If P2 delegates → action is A0 → same as playing A0 → payoff 5 → same.

So P2 is **indifferent** between playing A0 and delegating — both give payoff 5.

But **P2 has no incentive to change**.

So (you: delegate, P2: A0 or delegate) is a Nash equilibrium.

And you get 5.

But earlier symmetric mixed NE gave you only 3.

So **this is better**.

But is this stable?

But wait — P2 may consider: if I delegate, and you delegate — still A0 for both — you get 5, P2 gets 5 → same.

So P2 could delegate, but no gain.

So P2 can play A0 or delegate — both acceptable.

But if P2 **delegates**, then you might think: if P2 delegates, then the mediator gets 2 delegates → still plays A0.

So same outcome.

But now, suppose **you consider delegating**, but P2 is playing A0 — you get 5.

But what if P2 is playing randomly?

Let’s think of a symmetric equilibrium.

Suppose **both players use the same strategy**: they play A0 with probability p, A1 with q, A2 (delegate) with r, p+q+r=1.

But since A0 and A2 are both A0 actions, and it doesn’t matter which one you use, we can **combine them**.

Let’s define:
- Let **x** = probability you play A0 (directly) or A2 (delegate) → total probability you take action A0.
- Let **y** = probability you play A1.

Then **x + y = 1**, since delegate and direct A0 both give A0.

So effectively, your strategy reduces to choosing a probability x (for A0 action, either way) and y = 1−x (for A1).

Similarly for P2.

But Pu2’s strategy also has a mix of A0 (direct or delegate) and A1.

Now, in equilibrium, both players will have the same x.

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy.

Let x = probability each player plays A0 (either directly or via delegation).

Then probability each plays A1 is 1−x.

Now, what is the **expected payoff** to you?

We must consider all combinations.

But remember: if a player **delegates**, they contribute to the delegate count, but the action is always A0.

But for payoff purposes, only actions matter.

So outcomes depend only on:
- Player 1’s action: A0 or A1
- Player 2’s action: A0 or A1

And since **either direct A0 or delegation leads to A0**, the **action profile** depends only on whether each player plays A0 or A1.

The **delegation index doesn’t affect action**, only **how many delegates**, but that only affects the mediator’s choice — which is always A0 anyway.

So the **mediator’s behavior is irrelevant**: it always plays A0, regardless of number of delegates.

And since A0 is already the action if you play A0 or delegate, we can **ignore the delegation action** — it doesn’t change anything.

But wait

No — they **do** know the rules, but choose simultaneously.\n\nSo from your perspective, you (P1) are picking a strategy: a probability over A0, A1, A2.\n\nSame for P2.\n\nWe are to find a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies, where you are maximizing your expected payoff.\n\nLet’s think about **dominant strategies**.\n\nSuppose you consider whether to delegate or not.\n\nBut delegation = guaranteed A0.\n\nBut you could also play A0 directly.\n\nSo A0 and A2 are **strategically equivalent** only if P2’s behavior is the same.\n\nBut if you play A0, and P2 plays A0, you get 5.\n\nIf you delegate, and P2 plays A0, you get 5.\n\nSame.\n\nIf P2 plays A1:\n- You play A0 → you get 0\n- You delegate → you get 0\n\nSame.\n\nSo the **payoff consequences of delegating vs. playing A0 directly** are **identical**, in all cases.\n\nBut wait — is that true?\n\nOnly if **your actual action is the same**.\n\nYes: **in both cases (A0 or A2), your action is A0**, so the outcomes (and payoffs) are exactly the same.\n\nSo **A0 and A2 are identical in payoff implications**.\n\nTherefore, **you can combine them** — since they have same effect on outcome.\n\nBut wait — what about **P2’s belief**?\n\nNo — because the game is simultaneous, **no signaling** — you can’t communicate.\n\nAnd the mediator’s behavior is fixed and known.\n\nSo if delegation leads to the same action as playing A0, and no other effect (since P2 cannot condition on your action in advance), then **A2 is strictly equivalent to A0**.\n\nBut is that really true?\n\nWait — consider this: if you **delegate**, and P2 delegates, both play A0 → you get 5.\n\nIf you **play A0**, and P2 delegates, you play A0, P2 plays A0 → same.\n\nSame for all combinations.\n\nSo yes — **delegation has no strategic advantage** — it only forces you to play A0.\n\nBut you can already play A0 directly.\n\nTherefore, **A0 and A2 have identical payoffs**, for every combination of P2’s action.\n\nHence, from the **perspective of utility**, A0 and A2 are **interchangeable**.\n\nBut here’s a catch: **you can delegate even if you want to play A1** — but **you cannot**, because delegation forces A0.\n\nSo delegation is **not a way to play A1** — only A0.\n\nSo if you want to play A1, you must not delegate.\n\nBut if you play A0, you can do it directly, or delegate — both give same outcome.\n\nSo **in terms of payoff, A0 and A2 are identical**.\n\nSo in your strategy, you can **combine A0 and A2** — any mix between them has same expected payoff, as long as P2’s strategy is fixed.\n\nTherefore, to simplify, **you can treat A0 and A2 as equivalent**, and just decide how much to assign to "play A0" (either directly or via delegation), and how much to play A1.\n\nBut you must assign probabilities to **A0**, **A1**, and **A2**.\n\nBut since they behave identically, you can distribute the “A0” probability between A0 and A2 in any way.\n\nBut perhaps we should look for a **symmetric equilibrium**.\n\nBut here’s a better idea: **Since A0 and A2 are payoff-equivalent, we can use them interchangeably. But is there a benefit to delegating?**\n\nLet’s suppose both players are rational and know this.\n\nSuppose in equilibrium, **neither player delegates**.\n\nThen we are back to the original game.\n\nEarlier, we found a symmetric mixed strategy NE: each plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%.\n\nExpected payoff: 3.\n\nNow, suppose **you consider deviating** to delegation.\n\nSuppose you delegate (A2 = 100%).\n\nThen your action is A0.\n\nP2’s best response?\n\nP2 wants to maximize their own payoff.\n\nFrom P2’s perspective:\n- If you play A0 (via delegation or otherwise), P2’s payoff:\n  - If P2 plays A0 → 5\n  - If P2 plays A1 → 3\n\nSo P2 strictly prefers A0.\n\nSo if you are playing A0 (via delegation), P2 will play A0.\n\nSo outcome: (A0, A0) → you get 5.\n\nPreviously, in the mixed NE, you expected only 3.\n\nSo **by delegating, you get 5** — better.\n\nBut only if P2 responds by playing A0.\n\nBut in equilibrium, we must have mutual best responses.\n\nSo if you delegate (A2 = 100%), and P2 best responds by playing A0 → you get 5.\n\nBut what if P2 also considers **delegating**?\n\nIf P2 delegates, their action is also A0 (same as playing A0).\n\nSo P2 gets the same as if they played A0.\n\nSo P2 is indifferent between playing A0 and delegating.\n\nBut P2 will not get more by delegating.\n\nSo if you delegate (A0), P2 gets 5 if they play A0, 3 if they play A1.\n\nSo best response: play A0.\n\nDelegation is not better for P2 (since it gives A0, but doesn’t change their payoff).\n\nSo P2 will **not delegate** — because it doesn’t help them (same action, and no benefit).\n\nThey could just play A0.\n\nSo if you delegate (so you play A0), P2 will play A0 → you get 5.\n\nBut is that a stable equilibrium?\n\nLet’s check: suppose **you always delegate (A2 = 100%)**, and **P2 always plays A0**.\n\nThen:\n- You get 5\n- P2 gets 5\n\nNow, can you deviate?\n\nIf you play A0 instead of A2 — same action → same payoff → no benefit.\n\nIf you play A1 → then you play A1, P2 plays A0 → you get 3 → worse than 5 → so don’t want to.\n\nCan P2 deviate?\n\nIf P2 plays A1 → you play A0, P2 plays A1 → P2 gets 3, but currently gets 5 → so worse.\n\nIf P2 delegates → action is A0 → same as playing A0 → payoff 5 → same.\n\nSo P2 is **indifferent** between playing A0 and delegating — both give payoff 5.\n\nBut **P2 has no incentive to change**.\n\nSo (you: delegate, P2: A0 or delegate) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nAnd you get 5.\n\nBut earlier symmetric mixed NE gave you only 3.\n\nSo **this is better**.\n\nBut is this stable?\n\nBut wait — P2 may consider: if I delegate, and you delegate — still A0 for both — you get 5, P2 gets 5 → same.\n\nSo P2 could delegate, but no gain.\n\nSo P2 can play A0 or delegate — both acceptable.\n\nBut if P2 **delegates**, then you might think: if P2 delegates, then the mediator gets 2 delegates → still plays A0.\n\nSo same outcome.\n\nBut now, suppose **you consider delegating**, but P2 is playing A0 — you get 5.\n\nBut what if P2 is playing randomly?\n\nLet’s think of a symmetric equilibrium.\n\nSuppose **both players use the same strategy**: they play A0 with probability p, A1 with q, A2 (delegate) with r, p+q+r=1.\n\nBut since A0 and A2 are both A0 actions, and it doesn’t matter which one you use, we can **combine them**.\n\nLet’s define:\n- Let **x** = probability you play A0 (directly) or A2 (delegate) → total probability you take action A0.\n- Let **y** = probability you play A1.\n\nThen **x + y = 1**, since delegate and direct A0 both give A0.\n\nSo effectively, your strategy reduces to choosing a probability x (for A0 action, either way) and y = 1−x (for A1).\n\nSimilarly for P2.\n\nBut Pu2’s strategy also has a mix of A0 (direct or delegate) and A1.\n\nNow, in equilibrium, both players will have the same x.\n\nLet’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy.\n\nLet x = probability each player plays A0 (either directly or via delegation).\n\nThen probability each plays A1 is 1−x.\n\nNow, what is the **expected payoff** to you?\n\nWe must consider all combinations.\n\nBut remember: if a player **delegates**, they contribute to the delegate count, but the action is always A0.\n\nBut for payoff purposes, only actions matter.\n\nSo outcomes depend only on:\n- Player 1’s action: A0 or A1\n- Player 2’s action: A0 or A1\n\nAnd since **either direct A0 or delegation leads to A0**, the **action profile** depends only on whether each player plays A0 or A1.\n\nThe **delegation index doesn’t affect action**, only **how many delegates**, but that only affects the mediator’s choice — which is always A0 anyway.\n\nSo the **mediator’s behavior is irrelevant**: it always plays A0, regardless of number of delegates.\n\nAnd since A0 is already the action if you play A0 or delegate, we can **ignore the delegation action** — it doesn’t change anything.\n\nBut wait'

response:
Let’s carefully analyze this decision-making game with delegation, step by step, to determine the optimal mixed strategy for Player 1 (you) that maximizes your expected points.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (No Delegation)**
Payoff matrix (Player 1 payoff, Player 2 payoff):

|         | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **A0 (P1)** | (5,5) | (0,3) |
| **A1 (P1)** | (3,0) | (3,3) |

In this game:
- If both play A0: both get 5
- If P1 plays A0 and P2 plays A1: P1 gets 0, P2 gets 3
- If P1 plays A1 and P2 plays A0: P1 gets 3, P2 gets 0
- If both play A1: both get 3

This is similar to a coordination game with a tension between risk and reward. A1 is a safe choice (always at least 3), while A0 gives 5 if the other plays A0, but 0 if the other plays A1.

**Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (without delegation):**
- P1 plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%
- P2 plays A0 with 60%, A1 with 40%
- Expected payoff for each: **3**

---

### **Step 2: Introduce Delegation (A2 Action)**

You now have **three actions**:
- A0: play A0 directly
- A1: play A1 directly
- A2: delegate to the mediator

The mediator:
- If **1 player** delegates → plays A0
- If **2 players** delegate → plays A0

So, **regardless of how many delegates (1 or 2), the mediator plays A0**.

Therefore:
- If you choose A2 (delegate), your action is **A0**
- If you play A0 directly, your action is also A0

So, **A0 and A2 are payoff-equivalent**: in every outcome, they result in the same action (A0), so the same payoffs.

### **Key Insight:**
- A0 and A2 **have identical effects on the game**.
- The only difference is **your choice of action label** — but not the behavior.

Hence, **you can treat A0 and A2 as interchangeable** in terms of payoff outcomes.

But: is there a strategic advantage to delegating?

Yes — but only if it **changes the other player’s behavior**, or provides **commitment**.

Let’s consider this: **delegation is a commitment to A0**.

Suppose you delegate (A2), then you are **forced to play A0** — you cannot play A1.

But if you play A0 directly, you still play A0 — same action.

So delegation **does not expand your action space** — it only **restricts** you (you cannot play A1 if you delegate).

But you could always play A0 directly, so delegation adds no benefit unless it influences others.

---

### **Step 3: Can Delegation Induce Better Outcomes?**

Suppose you **always delegate (A2 = 100%)**.

Then your action is A0.

Now, consider P2’s best response:

- If P2 plays A0 → you both get 5
- If P2 plays A1 → you get 0, P2 gets 3

So P2 **prefers A0** when you play A0 — it gives them 5 vs 3.

Thus, **P2’s best response is to play A0**.

Delegation (A2) sends a **clear signal** that you are playing A0.

But: the game is **simultaneous** — P2 **cannot observe your choice before deciding**. So no signaling.

But if P2 **knows** the rules and the equilibrium structure, they can **reason** about it.

In a Nash equilibrium, both players must be playing best responses.

Suppose you always delegate → you play A0.

Then P2’s best response is to play A0 → you get 5.

Now, if you deviate to playing A1 (instead of delegating), then:
- You play A1
- P2 plays A0 (still best response) → you get 3 < 5 → worse.

So you prefer to delegate (or play A0) rather than A1.

Thus, **delegating gives you 5** — which is better than the 3 in the mixed equilibria.

But can P2 deviate? If P2 plays A1, they get 3, but currently get 5 → worse.

So P2 has no incentive to deviate.

Thus, the strategy:
- **You: Always delegate (A2 = 100%)**
- **P2: Play A0**

is a valid **Nash equilibrium**, and gives you **5 points**.

But what if P2 also considers delegating?

If P2 delegates, their action is A0 (same as playing A0), so they get 5 — same payoff.

So P2 is **indifferent** between playing A0 and delegating.

So P2 can play either — it doesn't affect their payoff.

But the **outcome** is the same: (A0, A0) → both get 5.

So as long as P2 does not play A1, you get 5.

---

### **Step 4: Is There a Better Equilibrium?**

Now consider: **Can you get a better expected payoff than 5?**

No — maximum possible payoff is 5 (when both play A0).

So 5 is the **maximum possible**.

And we have shown that by delegating (or playing A0), and if P2 plays A0, you get 5.

But P2 must be playing A0 for this to happen.

Now, is there a **symmetric equilibrium** where both players are randomizing?

Suppose both players use the same strategy.

Let:
- x = P(Play A0 or delegate) = P(Play A0-action)
- 1−x = P(Play A1)

Then probability of both playing A0-action: x²
- Outcome: (A0,A0) → you get 5

Probability of P1 A0, P2 A1: x(1−x) → you get 0  
Probability of P1 A1, P2 A0: (1−x)x → you get 3  
Probability of both A1: (1−x)² → you get 3

Expected payoff:
= 5×x² + 0×x(1−x) + 3×x(1−x) + 3×(1−x)²  
= 5x² + 3x(1−x) + 3(1−2x+x²)  
= 5x² + 3x - 3x² + 3 - 6x + 3x²  
= (5x² - 3x² + 3x²) + (3x - 6x) + 3  
= 5x² - 3x + 3

Maximize: 5x² - 3x + 3

Derivative: 10x - 3 = 0 → x = 0.3

But at x = 0.3, payoff = 5(0.09) - 3(0.3) + 3 = 0.45 - 0.9 + 3 = 2.55 < 5

So worse than the 5-point equilibrium.

Therefore, **a symmetric mixed strategy gives lower payoff**.

So the best you can do is to **coordinate on (A0,A0)**.

But how?

By **committing** to A0 — via **delegation**.

Because in the simultaneous-move game, if you play a mixed strategy, you risk playing A1, and then if P2 plays A0, you get only 3.

But **by delegating, you commit to A0**, which **induces P2 to play A0** (since they prefer 5 over 3), leading to (A0,A0).

So delegation is a **way to achieve coordination**.

---

### **Step 5: What Should Your Strategy Be?**

You want to **maximize expected payoff**.

The **best outcome is (A0,A0)** — you get 5.

To achieve this with certainty:
- You must **commit to A0**
- You must **induce P2 to play A0**

The only way to **commit to A0** is to either:
- Play A0 directly
- **Delegate** (A2)

But playing A0 directly does not commit you — you could still be randomizing.

But if you delegate, you **cannot play A1** — you must play A0.

So **delegation is a credible commitment** to A0.

Therefore, **delegating** signals “I am playing A0”, which makes P2 want to play A0.

And since they get 5 only if they play A0, they will.

Thus, **by delegating, you secure the (A0,A0) outcome** with certainty — **you get 5**.

Moreover, if you play A0 directly, you are not committed — if you randomize, you might play A1, and then you risk getting 0.

So to **guarantee coordination**, **delegation is better** than playing A0 directly.

Thus, **your best strategy is to delegate with probability 100%**.

But you still need to assign probabilities to **A0, A1, and A2**.

You **never** play A0 directly or A1 — because:
- Playing A0 directly is equivalent to delegating, but you lose the commitment benefit.
- Playing A1 is worse (only 3 or 0).

So you should assign:
- A2: 100%
- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%

But A0 and A2 are payoff-equivalent — so you could assign some to A0 and some to A2, but **you want to commit to A0**.

The **only way to commit** is to **delegate** — because if you play A0 directly, you still have the freedom to randomize.

But delegation removes that freedom.

Therefore, **to achieve the coordination equilibrium**, you must use delegation — not just play A0.

So **you should delegate with probability 100%**.

Thus, the optimal strategy is:
- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

This guarantees:
- You play A0
- P2 best responds with A0
- You get 5 points

And no deviation is profitable.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the optimal mixed strategy for Player 1 (you), given the rules and the possibility of delegating to a mediator.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

The base game is a two-player simultaneous-move game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 rows, Player 2 columns):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | 5, 5   | 0, 3   |
| **P1: A1**    | 3, 0   | 3, 3   |

This is a variant of a coordination game with some asymmetric incentives.

Let’s analyze the pure strategies:

- If both play A0: (5,5) → good for both.
- If P1 plays A0, P2 plays A1: (0,3) → P1 hates this.
- If P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0: (3,0) → P2 hates this.
- If both play A1: (3,3) → decent for both.

So, A0 is better for P1 when P2 plays A0, but risky if P2 plays A1.

This game has **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1).  
It also has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.

But now we have a **twist**: you can **delegate** your move to a mediator, which changes the dynamics.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism

You have a new action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**

The mediator behaves based on how many players have delegated to it:

- **If 1 player delegates**, mediator plays **A1**.
- **If 2 players delegate**, mediator plays **A0**.

Importantly, **the mediator's action is deterministic** based on the number of delegators.

So:
- If only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → you get the payoff as if you played A1.
- If both you and the other player delegate → mediator plays A0 → you get the payoff as if you played A0.
- If no one delegates → you play independently.
- If only the other player delegates → the mediator plays A1 → so the other player's move is effectively A1.

Let’s denote:
- Your action: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate).
- The other player’s action: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate).

---

### Step 3: Model the Outcome Based on Delegation

We need to consider all combinations of choices and compute the resulting payoffs.

Let’s define the possible cases:

#### Case 1: You choose A0, Other chooses A0
- No delegation → both play as chosen → (A0, A0) → payoff (5,5)

#### Case 2: You choose A0, Other chooses A1
- No delegation → (A0, A1) → you get 0, other gets 3

#### Case 3: You choose A0, Other chooses A2 (delegate)
- Only other player delegates → mediator plays A1 (since only 1 delegator) → so other player’s action is A1
- Your action: A0, other’s effective action: A1 → so (A0, A1) → you get 0, other gets 3

#### Case 4: You choose A1, Other chooses A0
- (A1, A0) → you get 3, other gets 0

#### Case 5: You choose A1, Other chooses A1
- (A1, A1) → you get 3, other gets 3

#### Case 6: You choose A1, Other chooses A2
- Only other player delegates → mediator plays A1 → other’s effective action: A1
- Your action: A1 → so (A1, A1) → you get 3, other gets 3

#### Case 7: You choose A2, Other chooses A0
- Only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → your effective action: A1
- Other’s action: A0 → so (A1, A0) → you get 3, other gets 0

#### Case 8: You choose A2, Other chooses A1
- Only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → your action: A1
- Other’s action: A1 → so (A1, A1) → you get 3, other gets 3

#### Case 9: You choose A2, Other chooses A2
- Both delegate → 2 delegators → mediator plays A0 → so both your actions are A0
- So (A0, A0) → you get 5, other gets 5

---

### Step 4: Summarize Payoffs for Each Combination

Let’s build a payoff table (your payoff, other player’s payoff) for each (your action, other’s action):

| Your Action | Other Action | Effective Action | Your Payoff | Other’s Payoff |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| A0          | A0           | (A0, A0)         | 5           | 5              |
| A0          | A1           | (A0, A1)         | 0           | 3              |
| A0          | A2           | (A0, A1)         | 0           | 3              |
| A1          | A0           | (A1, A0)         | 3           | 0              |
| A1          | A1           | (A1, A1)         | 3           | 3              |
| A1          | A2           | (A1, A1)         | 3           | 3              |
| A2          | A0           | (A1, A0)         | 3           | 0              |
| A2          | A1           | (A1, A1)         | 3           | 3              |
| A2          | A2           | (A0, A0)         | 5           | 5              |

---

### Step 5: Consider Best-Response and Equilibrium

We are to choose a **mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2 to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming the other player is rational and also optimizing.

But since both players are rational and symmetric in incentives (except for the mediator behavior), we can assume the game has a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

But note: **Player 2 proposed and selected the mediator**, so they may have strategic interest in influencing behavior.

However, the problem states that you are to **maximize your own points**, given that the other player will also play rationally.

So we need to find a **Nash equilibrium** in (possibly mixed) strategies.

Let’s suppose both players use the same mixed strategy (symmetric equilibrium).

Let:
- $ p $ = probability you play A0
- $ q $ = probability you play A1
- $ r $ = probability you play A2

Then $ p + q + r = 1 $

But since actions are symmetric in structure, let’s suppose the other player uses the same strategy.

Let’s compute your expected payoff as a function of your strategy and the other player’s strategy.

Let $ (p, q, r) $ be your strategy, and the other player uses $ (p', q', r') $.

But to find equilibrium, assume symmetry: $ p = p' $, $ q = q' $, $ r = r' $

We’ll compute expected payoff for you in each case.

---

### Step 6: Compute Expected Payoff (Symmetric Assumption)

Your expected payoff:
$$
EU = \sum_{\text{all pairs}} \text{Prob}(your action, other's action) \times \text{Your Payoff}
$$

We’ll compute the expected payoff if both players use the same mixed strategy: $ p $ for A0, $ q $ for A1, $ r $ for A2.

Note: $ p + q + r = 1 $

Now compute expectation:

We go through each of the 9 combination cases, compute their probability and your payoff.

1. You A0, other A0: prob = $ p \cdot p $, payoff = 5
2. You A0, other A1: $ p \cdot q $, payoff = 0
3. You A0, other A2: $ p \cdot r $, payoff = 0
4. You A1, other A0: $ q \cdot p $, payoff = 3
5. You A1, other A1: $ q \cdot q $, payoff = 3
6. You A1, other A2: $ q \cdot r $, payoff = 3
7. You A2, other A0: $ r \cdot p $, payoff = 3
8. You A2, other A1: $ r \cdot q $, payoff = 3
9. You A2, other A2: $ r \cdot r $, payoff = 5

Now sum:

$$
EU = 5 \cdot p^2 + 0 \cdot (p q + p r) + 3 \cdot (q p + q^2 + q r + r p + r q) + 5 \cdot r^2
$$

Break it down:

- $ 5 p^2 $
- $ 5 r^2 $
- Terms with payoff 3:
  - $ q p $: $ p q $
  - $ q^2 $
  - $ q r $
  - $ r p $
  - $ r q $

So total 3-multiplied terms: $ pq + q^2 + qr + rp + rq = pq + q^2 + 2qr + rp $

But $ rp = pr $, so we can write: $ pq + q^2 + 2qr + pr $

So:

$$
EU = 5p^2 + 5r^2 + 3(pq + pr + q^2 + 2qr)
$$

Wait — let’s recheck: from above:

- $ q p = pq $
- $ q^2 $
- $ q r $
- $ r p = pr $
- $ r q = qr $

So total: $ pq + q^2 + qr + pr + qr = pq + q^2 + pr + 2qr $

Yes.

So:
$$
EU = 5p^2 + 5r^2 + 3(pq + pr + q^2 + 2qr)
$$

Now simplify:

$$
EU = 5p^2 + 5r^2 + 3pq + 3pr + 3q^2 + 6qr
$$

Now, since $ p + q + r = 1 $, we can express everything in terms of $ p, q, r $.

But we want to find the values of $ p, q, r $ (non-negative, sum to 100%) that **maximize EU** **in a symmetric Nash equilibrium**.

In symmetric Nash equilibrium, no player wants to deviate unilaterally. So best response to your strategy is to play the same.

So we take derivative and set to zero, but easier to think heuristically.

---

### Step 7: Try to Find a Symmetric Equilibrium

Let’s consider **possible equilibria**.

#### Candidate 1: Both always delegate (r = 1)

Then both play A2 → both get 5.

Suppose you deviate to A0: then you play A0, other plays A2 → other's action is A1 → so (A0, A1) → you get 0 < 5 → bad.

Deviate to A1: you play A1, other A2 → other plays A1 → so (A1, A1) → you get 3 < 5 → still worse.

So both getting 5 is stable. **So (A2, A2) is a Nash equilibrium** with payoff (5,5).

So you can guarantee 5 by playing A2.

#### Candidate 2: Both play A0 (p=1)

Then (A0, A0) → payoff 5 each.

But if you deviate to A2: then you delegate, other plays A0 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → your effective action is A1, other plays A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 3 < 5 → not better.

Deviate to A1: you get (A1, A0) → 3 < 5 → not better.

So (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium.

But now consider if both play A1 (q=1):

Then (A1, A1) → you get 3.

If you deviate to A2: you delegate, other plays A1 → only you delegate → mediator plays A1 → your action: A1 → so still (A1, A1)? No:

Wait: if you deviate to A2, you delegate → only one delegator (you), so mediator plays A1 → your action: A1.

Other plays A1 → so (A1, A1) → payoff 3. Same.

So you can't gain by deviating → (A1, A1) is **also a Nash equilibrium**, but payoff 3 < 5.

So not better.

Now, can we do better than 5?

Maximum possible is 5 (from A0,A0 or A2,A2).

But in A0,A0, you get 5. In A2,A2, you get 5.

But can we get more than 5? No — max payoff is 5.

So 5 is the best possible.

Now the question: **Can we design a mixed strategy that gives you more than 5 in expectation?**

No, because 5 is the maximum possible per round.

So any strategy that gives you expected payoff >5 is impossible.

Therefore, **5 is the maximum possible**.

So if we can guarantee 5 in expectation, that’s optimal.

Now, let’s check if there’s a **mixed strategy** that gives **expected payoff 5**, but perhaps more stability.

But we already have two pure equilibria where you get 5: (A0,A0) and (A2,A2).

So you can safely choose A2 and get 5 in symmetric equilibrium.

But is (A2,A2) robust?

Suppose the other player is not rational, or might not follow equilibrium.

But since we are to find a strategy that **maximizes your expected payoff under rational play**, and in Nash equilibrium you get 5, that’s best possible.

But is there a mixed strategy where **even if the other player plays differently**, you can do better?

Let’s suppose the other player plays **A0** with high probability.

Then your best response?

- Play A0 → get 5 if they play A0, 0 if they play A1 or A2 (since delegating leads to A1).

Wait: if they play A0, and you play A0 → 5

If they play A0 and you play A1 → 3

If they play A0 and you play A2 → your action becomes A1 → (A1,A0) → 3

So best is A0 → 5

Similarly, if they play A1:
- You play A0 → (A0, A1) → 0
- You play A1 → (A1, A1) → 3
- You play A2 → (A1, A1) → 3
→ best is A1 or A2 → 3

If they play A2 → then their action is A1 → same as playing A1 → so best for you to play A1 or A2 → 3

So your best response depends on their move.

But if both players are rational, and know this, they might coordinate on (A0,A0) or (A2,A2)

Now, which one is better?

Suppose you believe the other player will play A2 with high probability → then they are effectively playing A1 → so you should play A1 → but then you get only 3.

But if you play A2, and they play A2 → you get 5.

So (A2,A2) is a good equilibrium.

But here’s a key insight: **If both players choose A2, you both get 5**.

But if only one does, you get only 3.

So (A2,A2) requires **mutual trust** — but it’s still an equilibrium.

But now, is **A2 a dominant strategy**? No.

But here’s another idea: **Can we use delegation in a way that forces coordination?**

Suppose you **always delegate (A2)**.

Then:
- If the other player plays A0: you play A1 (since only you delegate) → (A1, A0) → you get 3
- If the other player plays A1: you play A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3
- If the other player plays A2: both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 5

So your expected payoff depends on the other player’s action.

If they play A2 with probability $ x $, then:
- With probability $ x $: you get 5
- With probability $ 1 - x $: you get 3
→ Expected payoff = $ 5x + 3(1 - x) = 3 + 2x $

So if you always delegate, your payoff is $ 3 + 2x $, where $ x $ is probability other player delegates.

But $ x $ is chosen by the other player.

So if you assume they will play rational best response, what will they do?

Suppose you always delegate → so you play A2.

Then their best response:
- If they play A0: payoff = 0 (since you're playing A1) → (A1, A0) → they get 0
- If they play A1: (A1, A1) → they get 3
- If they play A2: (A0, A0) → they get 5

So best for them is A2 → they will play A2 → so $ x = 1 $

Then your payoff is 5.

So if you play A2, and they best-response, they play A2, and you get 5.

Similarly, if you play A0, and they play A0 → you get 5.

But if you play A0, and they play A0 → you get 5.

But if they are rational, they might not play A0 if they think you’ll exploit them.

Wait — suppose you play A0.

Then their best response:
- If they play A0: (A0, A0) → they get 5
- If they play A1: (A0, A1) → they get 3
- If they play A2: you’re playing A0, other’s action: A1 → (A0, A1) → they get 3

So best is A0 → they will play A0.

Then you get 5.

So both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are stable: you get 5 in both.

So you can reach 5 via either.

But can you do better than 5? No.

So maximum expected payoff is 5.

Now, is there a **mixed strategy** that gives you **more than 5 in expected payoff**? No.

So 5 is upper bound.

But perhaps a mixed strategy gives 5 **with higher probability** or more risk-averse.

But since we just want **maximize expected points**, 5 is best.

Now, can we find a **credible strategy** that makes the other player play A2?

Here’s an idea: if you always delegate (A2), and they believe you will, they are best off playing A2 too → so they do.

So you can **guarantee** 5 by playing A2.

Similarly, playing A0 also guarantees 5 if they play A0.

But what if you mix?

Suppose you play A0 with some probability, A2 with some.

But consider: suppose you play A0 with 50%, A2 with 50%.

Then your expected payoff depends on what the other player does.

If they play A0:
- You play A0: (A0,A0) → 5
- You play A2: (A1,A0) → 3
→ Expected: 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4

If they play A1:
- You play A0 → (A0,A1) → 0
- You play A2 → (A1,A1) → 3
→ Expected: 0.5×0 + 0.5×3 = 1.5

If they play A2:
- You play A0 → (A0,A1) → 0
- You play A2 → (A0,A0) → 5
→ Expected: 0.5×0 + 0.5×5 = 2.5

So your expected payoff is low in all cases, maximized at 4 if they play A0.

But they may not play A0 — they will play best response.

If you mixed with (A0:50%, A2:50%), what will they do?

Suppose you play A0:50%, A2:50%

Then your effective action distribution:
- A0 with 50%
- A1 with 50% (from A2)

So they face: 50% A0, 50% A1

Now compute their expected payoff for each choice:

- Play A0: 
  - 50% chance (you A0) → (A0,A0) → they get 5
  - 50% chance (you A2 → A1) → (A0,A1) → they get 3
  → EU = 0.5×5 + 0.5×3 = 4

- Play A1:
  - 50% (you A0) → (A1,A0) → they get 0
  - 50% (you A2 → A1) → (A1,A1) → 3
  → EU = 0.5×0 + 0.5×3 = 1.5

- Play A2:
  - 50% (you A0) → other's action A1 → (A1,A1) → they get 3
  - 50% (you A2) → both delegate → (A0,A0) → they get 5
  → EU = 0.5×3 + 0.5×5 = 4

So best for them is A0 or A2 → both give 4.

So they might choose A0 or A2.

Suppose they choose A0 → then your expected payoff is 4 (as above) — less than 5.

So not better.

Hence, **pure strategy A2 gives you 5**, while mixed strategies give less or equal.

But can you do better than 5? No.

So best expected payoff is 5.

Now, which strategy gives **5**?

- Play A2: if other plays A2, you get 5. If they best respond, they will play A2 → so you get 5.
- Play A0: if they play A0, you get 5. They will best respond to A0 by playing A0 → so you get 5.

So both are valid.

But **is there a reason to prefer A2 over A0**?

Let’s see the **risk**.

Suppose the other player is **not perfectly rational**, or might make a mistake.

But in standard game theory, we assume rationality.

But here’s a key difference:

- If you play A0, and the other player plays A1 by mistake, you get 0.
- If you play A2, and they play A1, you get 3.
- If they play A0, you get 3.

So A2 is **less risky**: minimum payoff is 3, while A0 has a risk of 0.

A2 yields minimum 3, maximum 5.

A0 yields minimum 0, maximum 5.

So **A2 is more robust** to errors.

Moreover, in the delegation mechanism, **A2 is a way to force coordination via the mediator**.

Specifically, **if both delegate, you get A0,A0**, which is the high-payoff outcome.

So **A2 is a coordination device**.

In fact, you can think of A2 as a “commitment” to cooperate: you’re saying, "I’ll delegate, so let’s both do it to get A0,A0."

And since the mediator plays A0 when both delegate, it rewards coordination.

So A2 is not just an option — it’s a **way to achieve the best outcome** (5,5) through mutual delegation.

Moreover, as we saw, if you play A2, the other player's best response is A2 (since it gives them 5, vs 3 for others).

So (A2,A2) is a **strict Nash equilibrium**.

Similarly, (A0,A0) is also strict.

But A2 gives you a **better safety net**.

Therefore, **best strategy is to always delegate: A2 = 100%**.

### Final Check:

- If you play A2 (100%), and other plays A2 → you get 5.
- If other plays A0 → you get 3 (worse).
- If other plays A1 → you get 3.

But if other is rational, they will play A2 to get 5.

So in equilibrium, you get 5.

And you cannot get more than 5.

And the strategy is simple: delegate.

### Can you mix?

Suppose you consider playing A0 with some probability.

But if you do, you lower your payoff if they play A2 (because you might play A0, leading to (A0,A1), you get 0).

So mixing doesn’t help.

Therefore, **optimal strategy is to always delegate**: **A2 = 100%**.

So probabilities:

- A0: 0
- A1: 0
- A2: 100

Sum = 100.

prompt:

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 2 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break this down step by step, carefully analyzing the game, the strategic implications of delegation, and how to maximize your expected points as **Player 2**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

The payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2) is:

| Player 1 \ Player 2 | A0       | A1       |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **A0**              | (5, 5)   | (0, 3)   |
| **A1**              | (3, 0)   | (3, 3)   |

This is a **coordination game with a twist**. Let's analyze pure strategy equilibria.

- If both play A0: (5,5)
- If both play A1: (3,3)
- If one plays A0 and other A1: (0,3) or (3,0)

So both A0-A0 and A1-A1 are Nash equilibria.

But A0-A0 gives the highest payoff for both. However, if you expect the other player to play A0, you want to play A0. If you expect them to play A1, you're indifferent (both A0 and A1 give 3). But playing A1 when they play A0 gives you 0 — so A1 is risky if they play A0.

This suggests a **battle of the sexes**-like structure. However, we are not playing alone — we have the **delegation option**, which changes everything.

### **Step 2: Understand the Delegation Mechanism**

You can choose **A2: Delegate to Mediator**.

The mediator's behavior is:
- If **only one** player delegates, mediator plays **A1**
- If **two** players delegate, mediator plays **A0**

But only **one mediator** is available. So whether you delegate or not depends on **both players’ choices**.

You are **Player 2**. The game has two players. Both can delegate.

Let’s define the possible **states** based on delegation choices:

| You (P2) | Other Player (P1) | # Delegating | Mediator Plays |
|---------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| A0      | A0               | 0            | — (no delegation) |
| A0      | A1               | 0            | — |
| A0      | A2               | 1            | A1             |
| A1      | A0               | 0            | — |
| A1      | A1               | 0            | — |
| A1      | A2               | 1            | A1             |
| A2      | A0               | 1            | A1             |
| A2      | A1               | 1            | A1             |
| A2      | A2               | 2            | A0             |

Note: The mediator only plays **if at least one player delegates**. And its choice depends on **how many** delegate.

Importantly: the mediator acts **on behalf of delegators** — so if you delegate, your action is determined by the mediator, based on the total number of delegators.

So, **your action is not free if you delegate** — it is fixed by the mediator’s rule.

---

### **Step 3: Determine Your Best Response Given Others’ Strategies**

We are to **choose a mixed strategy** that maximizes **your expected payoff**, considering that the other player is also choosing a strategy (possibly mixed), and we must be robust to their choice.

But since you are trying to **maximize your own points**, and you don't know the other player’s strategy, we should look for a **Nash equilibrium** or a **dominant strategy**, or at least a **robust, symmetric-intuitive strategy**.

But note: **You can influence outcomes via delegation**, and the mediator behaves **deterministically** based on total delegations.

Let’s consider your **options** and their payoffs, depending on the **other player’s choice**.

We need to consider the **combined outcome** (your action, their action) and compute **your expected payoff**.

Since the other player can also delegate, and all choices are simultaneous and independent, we need to model a **mixed strategy over {A0, A1, A2}** that maximizes expected payoff.

Let’s denote your strategy as:
- p0: probability you play A0
- p1: probability you play A1
- p2: probability you play A2

With p0 + p1 + p2 = 100.

We need to find optimal p0, p1, p2.

But the complexity comes from **the mediator’s behavior depending on joint delegation**.

Let’s examine **what happens in each combination** of actions (yours vs theirs), and compute **your payoff**, then average over all outcomes.

Let’s suppose **both players** independently choose actions (including possibly delegating). The joint outcome determines the effective actions.

Let’s think: what if both players **always delegate**? Then both delegate → 2 players delegate → mediator plays A0.

So both play A0 → you get 5 points.

Good outcome.

What if **only one player delegates**? Then mediator plays A1.

So the delegator plays A1, the other player's action is what they chose (A0 or A1).

But if a player delegates, their action is **not** A0 or A1 — it’s determined by the mediator.

So let’s redefine the **effective action** based on choices.

Let’s define the **effective action** for each player:

- If you play A0: your action is A0
- If you play A1: your action is A1
- If you play A2 (delegate): your action is:
  - A1 if **only one** other player delegates (so total=1)
  - A0 if **both** delegate (total=2)

Similarly for the other player.

So the **effective actions** depend on both players’ choices.

We need to go through all combinations and compute payoffs.

Let’s do that.

---

### **Step 4: Enumerate All 9 Possible Strategy Combinations**

Assume both players choose independently. We’ll compute **expected payoff to you** under each pair of choices (your choice, other’s choice), then average over strategies.

Let’s define:

- Your action → determined by your choice
- Other player’s action → determined by their choice
- Mediator’s action → depends on how many delegate

Then compute your payoff.

We’ll analyze for all 9 combinations (excluding symmetry where both don’t delegate), and capture the payoffs.

| Your Choice | Their Choice | # Delegating | Mediator Action | Your Effective Action | Their Effective Action | Your Payoff |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| A0          | A0           | 0             | —                | A0                     | A0                      | 5           |
| A0          | A1           | 0             | —                | A0                     | A1                      | 0           |
| A0          | A2           | 1             | A1               | A0                     | A1                      | 0           |
| A1          | A0           | 0             | —                | A1                     | A0                      | 3           |
| A1          | A1           | 0             | —                | A1                     | A1                      | 3           |
| A1          | A2           | 1             | A1               | A1                     | A1                      | 3           |
| A2          | A0           | 1             | A1               | A1                     | A0                      | 3           |
| A2          | A1           | 1             | A1               | A1                     | A1                      | 3           |
| A2          | A2           | 2             | A0               | A0                     | A0                      | 5           |

Now, let’s simplify:

- A0 vs A0 → (A0, A0) → payoff: 5
- A0 vs A1 → (A0, A1) → payoff: 0
- A0 vs A2 → (A0, A1) → payoff: 0
- A1 vs A0 → (A1, A0) → payoff: 3
- A1 vs A1 → (A1, A1) → payoff: 3
- A1 vs A2 → (A1, A1) → payoff: 3
- A2 vs A0 → (A1, A0) → payoff: 3
- A2 vs A1 → (A1, A1) → payoff: 3
- A2 vs A2 → (A0, A0) → payoff: 5

So, your payoff depends on:

- Only when **both play A0 or both play A2**, you get 5.
- In all other cases, you get either 3 or 0.

Specifically:

- You get **5** when:
  - (A0, A0)
  - (A2, A2)

- You get **3** when:
  - (A1, A0)
  - (A1, A1)
  - (A1, A2)
  - (A2, A0)
  - (A2, A1)

- You get **0** when:
  - (A0, A1)
  - (A0, A2)

So the **only bad outcomes** are when **you play A0 and the other plays A1 or A2** — because then the other plays A1, you play A0 → you get 0.

Otherwise, if you play A1 or A2, you get at least 3.

And if both play A2, you both play A0 → you get 5.

So the **key** is to avoid the 0-payoff states.

Let’s now suppose the other player uses some strategy, and we want to **maximize our own expected payoff**, possibly assuming they are rational too.

But since we’re trying to **maximize our own expected points**, and the game is symmetric in structure (both players have same actions and payoffs), we can look for a **symmetric equilibrium**.

Let’s suppose **both players use the same strategy**:
- p0: P(A0)
- p1: P(A1)
- p2: P(A2)
With p0 + p1 + p2 = 100

Then the expected payoff to you is:

E[Payoff] = Σ P(you=choice, other=choice) × payoff

From above:

- Payoff = 5 when:
  - (A0, A0): prob = p0 * p0 → 5
  - (A2, A2): prob = p2 * p2 → 5

- Payoff = 3 when:
  - (A1, A0): p1 * p0
  - (A1, A1): p1 * p1
  - (A1, A2): p1 * p2
  - (A2, A0): p2 * p0
  - (A2, A1): p2 * p1

- Payoff = 0 when:
  - (A0, A1): p0 * p1
  - (A0, A2): p0 * p2

So total expected payoff:

E = 5*(p0² + p2²) + 3*(p1 p0 + p1² + p1 p2 + p2 p0 + p2 p1) + 0*(p0 p1 + p0 p2)

Simplify:

Note: p0 + p1 + p2 = 1

Let’s write E as:

E = 5(p0² + p2²) + 3(p1 p0 + p1² + 2 p1 p2 + p2 p0)

But since we’re now thinking about **best response**, perhaps we can consider what strategy best **protects against worst-case** others, or **maximizes minimum payoff**.

But since the mediator **rewards coordination of delegation**, and leads to the high payoff (5) when both delegate, maybe **both delegating is a good coordination point**.

Also note: **Delegating is only bad for you if you are the only one delegating and the other plays A1** → in that case, you play A1, they play A1 → you get 3 (good). Or if other plays A0, you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3.

Wait — check:

- If you delegate (A2) and they play A0: you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3 → good
- If you delegate and they play A1: you play A1, they play A1 → you get 3 → good
- If you delegate and they delegate: you both play A0 → you get 5 → best

Only downside: if you play A0 and they play A1 or A2 → you get 0.

So **A0 is dangerous** — if you play A0, and the other player plays A1 or A2, you get 0.

But if you **never play A0**, you never get 0.

So **A0 is riskiest**.

Now, consider playing either A1 or A2:

- A1: safe, gives at least 3
- A2: gives 3 or 5, never 0

So to avoid the possibility of getting 0, you should **never play A0**.

So set **p0 = 0**

Now, can we do better?

Now you choose between A1 and A2.

Let’s suppose you play only A1 and A2.

Let p = probability you play A2 (delegation), so 1-p = probability you play A1.

Now suppose the other player uses the **same** strategy: q = P(they play A2), so 1-q = P(they play A1)

But to maximize your **minimum** payoff or find **equilibrium**, let’s suppose both players use the same strategy: p2 = p, p1 = 1-p, p0 = 0

Then expected payoff for you:

E = 5*(p²) + 3*( (1-p)*p + (1-p)² + (1-p)*p + p*p + p*(1-p) ) + 0*(0)

Wait — from earlier:

With p0 = 0:

- (A0, A0): prob = 0
- (A0, A1): 0
- (A0, A2): 0
- (A1, A0): 0
- (A1, A1): (1-p)(1-p) → payoff 3
- (A1, A2): (1-p)p → payoff 3
- (A2, A0): 0
- (A2, A1): p(1-p) → payoff 3
- (A2, A2): p * p → payoff 5

So E = 3*[(1-p)² + (1-p)p + p(1-p)] + 5*p²

Simplify:

The three 3-payoff terms:

- (1-p)²
- (1-p)p
- p(1-p)

So sum = (1 - 2p + p²) + p - p² + p - p² = 1 - 2p + p² + 2p - 2p² = 1 - p²

Wait let's compute numerically:

(1-p)² = 1 - 2p + p²  
(1-p)p = p - p²  
p(1-p) = p - p²  

Sum = (1 - 2p + p²) + (p - p²) + (p - p²) = 1 - 2p + p² + p - p² + p - p² = 1 - p²

Yes! Sum = 1 - p²

Then E = 3*(1 - p²) + 5*p² = 3 - 3p² + 5p² = 3 + 2p²

This is **increasing in p**.

So the **higher p (probability of delegating)**, the **better** your expected payoff, under the assumption that both players use the same strategy.

Maximum when p = 1 → E = 3 + 2(1) = 5

So if both always delegate, you get 5 with certainty.

And if you always delegate (p=1), and the other player is rational, they also might benefit from it.

But is this stable?

Suppose you **always delegate** (p=1), so you play A2.

Then, depending on what the other player does:

- If they play A0: you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3
- If they play A1: you play A1, they play A1 → you get 3
- If they play A2: you both play A0 → you get 5

So **you get 5 only if they also delegate**.

If they don’t, you get 3.

So your payoff is:

- 5 if they delegate (p2 = 1)
- 3 otherwise

So your expected payoff is: 5*q + 3*(1-q) = 3 + 2q

Now, what should **they** do?

If they are rational and maximize their own points, and they see you are always delegating, then they get:

- If they play A0: you play A1 (since you delegated), they play A0 → they get 3
- If they play A1: you play A1, they play A1 → they get 3
- If they play A2: you play A0, they play A0 → they get 5

So **best for them is to delegate** → gets 5.

So they will delegate.

So **if you delegate**, and they are rational, **they will delegate too**, because it's the only way they get 5.

Thus, **if you always delegate**, and the other player is rational, they will also delegate → both play A0 → you both get 5.

Perfect.

Now, is **delegate your only best response**?

Suppose you **don’t delegate** — say you play A1.

Then depending on the other player:

- If they play A0: you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3
- If they play A1: you play A1, they play A1 → you get 3
- If they play A2: you play A1, they play A0 → you get 3

So **if you play A1**, you **always get 3**, regardless of what they do.

Similarly, if you play A2, your payoff is:
- If they play A0: you get 3
- If they play A1: you get 3
- If they play A2: you get 5

So if they are rational, they will play A2 → so you get 5.

But if they are not rational, you might get only 3.

So your **expected payoff from A1 is 3** (no risk).

From **A2**, your payoff is **at least 3**, and could be 5.

But if you play A2, you get **5 if they delegate**, 3 otherwise.

But if **you play A2**, and they play A0 or A1, you get 3, but they get 0 or 3 — so they have **no incentive** to depute.

Wait — if you play A2, and they play A0, then:
- You: A1 (via mediator)
- They: A0
- You get 3, they get 0

So they **lose** by not delegating.

If they play A1: you both play A1 → they get 3 (same as if they played A1 alone)

But with A2, you play A1, so they get 3 if they play A1.

If they play A2: they get 5.

So **rational player will want to delegate if you delegate**, because they get 5.

Thus: **if you delegate, the other player has incentive to delegate too**, so you get 5.

If you don’t delegate, you get only 3 at best.

So **a dominant strategy**? Not quite — but it's **strictly better to delegate** than to play A1, because:

- A1: guaranteed 3 (no matter what)
- A2: you get 5 **if they delegate**, which they will **if they are rational and see you delegating**.

So unless the other player is irrational, you get **5** by delegating.

But even if they are irrational, if they don't delegate, you get 3.

So **you get at least 3, possibly 5**.

But playing A1 gives you guaranteed 3.

So **delegating is weakly better** — same minimum, higher maximum.

And in equilibrium, you get 5.

Now, what about A0? Playing A0 can **only hurt** you.

If you play A0, and they play A1 or A2, you get 0.

So **A0 is riskiest**.

So you should **never play A0**.

Therefore, **optimal strategy is to never play A0**, and **prefer A2 over A1**, because it offers the chance of 5 and avoids 0.

Now, should you play **only A2**?

Yes — because if you mix A1 and A2, you lower your expected payoff.

Suppose you play A2 with probability p, A1 with 1-p.

Then expected payoff, assuming other player is rational and delegates if you do (so they play A2), then:

- If they delegate: you both play A0 → you get 5
- If they don’t: you get 0 or 3, but they **will** delegate — so you get 5

But if your strategy is mixed, and they see you might not delegate, they may not delegate.

But if the other player knows you are mixing, they might still **delegate if they expect you to**.

But in a symmetric equilibrium, it’s best to **commit to delegation**.

Let’s suppose **both players use A2 with probability 1**.

Then both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both get 5.

Is this a Nash equilibrium?

Check: if you deviate to A0, then you get:
- If other plays A2 → you are A0, they are A1 → you get 0 → worse than 5 → bad

If you deviate to A1:
- You play A1, they play A0 → you get 3 → worse than 5

So **no incentive to deviate**.

Similarly for the other player.

So **(A2, A2)** is a **Nash equilibrium** → both players get 5.

Now, is there a better one?

Suppose you play A2 with probability 1, other plays A2 with probability 1 → 5.

Any other pure strategy gives ≤ 3.

So yes, **(A2, A2)** is best equilibrium.

Can you do better than 5? No — maximum possible payoff is 5.

So **optimal**.

Now, what if the other player doesn’t play A2?

But if you **commit** to A2, and they are rational, **they will** play A2 to get 5.

So you can **force** the coordination.

Therefore, your best move is to **always delegate**.

That is: **p2 = 100**, p0 = 0, p1 = 0

Then:

- You never play A0
- You never play A1
- You always delegate → so once the other player sees you delegate, they will too

Thus, expected payoff = 5

Any other choice gives less than or equal to 5, and often less.

Even if the other player is not rational, you avoid 0 — you get at least 3

But playing A0 risks 0.

So **optimal to delegate always**.

### ✅ Final Decision:

**Strategy: Always delegate to mediator**

- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 100%

This maximizes your expected points under the assumption of rational play (common knowledge), and protects against worst-case outcomes better than playing A0 or A1.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

We are playing a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a modified version of a coordination game with a twist. Let's analyze the Nash equilibria of this base game first.

- If both play A0: (5,5) — high payoff
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1: you get 0, they get 3
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0: you get 3, they get 0
- If both play A1: (3,3)

So:
- (A0, A0) is a clear Pareto optimal and mutual best response.
- But if you fear the other will play A1, you might prefer A1 to avoid getting 0.
- (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium because neither player benefits from deviating alone (if the other plays A1, you get 3 either way).
- (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium: if the other plays A0, you get 5 by playing A0 and only 3 by playing A1 → best to play A0.

So there are **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). There may also be a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But now comes the twist: **we can delegate to a mediator**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Mediator

You have a new action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**

The mediator’s behavior:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note: You are Player 1. The other player (Player 2) is also choosing their action, possibly delegating.

So we need to consider the **strategic interaction** between:
- Your decision: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- Player 2's decision: A0, A1, or A2

But since you are trying to **maximize your own expected payoff**, and you are Player 1, you need to think about what distribution over actions you should choose, considering Player 2’s potential actions.

But here’s the catch: **the mediator acts based on how many players delegated** — not who they are. So the outcome depends on the **number** of players delegating.

Let’s list all possible cases based on how many players delegate.

---

### Step 3: Enumerate Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation

Let’s consider the joint actions between you (P1) and Player 2.

We’ll analyze the outcome (your payoff) in each scenario.

---

#### Case 1: Neither delegates (P1: A0 or A1, P2: A0 or A1)
- No one delegates → mediator not used
- So both play their chosen actions directly.
- This reduces to the base game.

You choose A0 or A1, same as P2.
- (A0, A0): you get 5
- (A0, A1): you get 0
- (A1, A0): you get 3
- (A1, A1): you get 3

(We’ll come back to optimize over this — but note that A0 and A1 are not available here unless you directly choose them.)

But wait: if you **don’t delegate**, you choose A0 or A1 directly.

So “not delegating” means you play A0 or A1 with some probability.

So we have to model this as a game where each player chooses between:
- Play A0
- Play A1
- Delegate (A2)

So the space is 3×3 = 9 possible combinations.

Let’s go through all 9.

---

### Step 4: Full Payoff Table (Player 1’s Payoff in Each Case)

Let’s define:

- P1's action: A0, A1, A2
- P2's action: A0, A1, A2

Then compute P1’s **expected payoff** based on:
- Who delegates
- How many delegates
- Mediator’s action

Let’s list all 9 possibilities.

---

#### 1. P1: A0, P2: A0
- No delegation → both play A0
- Payoff: **5**

#### 2. P1: A0, P2: A1
- No delegation → (A0, A1)
- Payoff: **0**

#### 3. P1: A0, P2: A2
- P1 plays A0 directly; P2 delegates
- So only 1 player (P2) delegates → mediator plays A1
- P1 plays A0
- P2's effective action: A1
- So outcome: (A0, A1)
- P1 gets **0**

#### 4. P1: A1, P2: A0
- No delegation → (A1, A0)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 5. P1: A1, P2: A1
- No delegation → (A1, A1)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 6. P1: A1, P2: A2
- P1 plays A1, P2 delegates
- Only P2 delegates → 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**
- So P2’s effective action: A1
- P1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 7. P1: A2, P2: A0
- P1 delegates, P2 plays A0
- 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**
- So P1’s effective action: A1
- P2 plays A0
- Outcome: (A1, A0)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 8. P1: A2, P2: A1
- P1 delegates, P2 plays A1
- 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**
- P1’s action: A1 (via mediator)
- P2 plays A1
- Outcome: (A1, A1)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 9. P1: A2, P2: A2
- Both delegate → 2 delegators → mediator plays **A0**
- So P1’s action: A0
- P2’s action: A0
- Outcome: (A0, A0)
- P1 gets **5**

---

### Step 5: Summarize P1’s Payoff in Each Scenario

| P1\P2 | A0       | A1       | A2       |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 5        | 0        | 0        |
| **A1**  | 3        | 3        | 3        |
| **A2**  | 3        | 3        | 5        |

Interesting!

So:
- If you play A0, your payoff depends on P2:
  - A0 → 5
  - A1 → 0
  - A2 → 0
- If you play A1, you always get 3 (regardless of what P2 does)
- If you play A2, you get:
  - 3 if P2 plays A0 or A1
  - 5 if P2 plays A2

So A2 is **only better than A1** when P2 also delegates.

But if P2 delegates, you get 5 (vs 3 if you play A1), so it's strictly better.

But you don’t know what P2 will do — this is a strategic choice.

---

Now the key insight: We need to **choose a mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2 to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming Player 2 is also rational and choosing their own best response.

But since you are the only one to submit the strategy, and we assume both players are rational, we might look for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But the game is symmetric? Let's see.

Wait: is it symmetric? Not exactly — you are told Player 2 proposed the mediator, but since it was approved by all (and there are only two players), it makes sense. But the **mediator’s behavior** is symmetric — it only depends on the number of delegators.

Also, the payoff table is symmetric.

So the game is symmetric. So we can look for a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

But you’re asking to **maximize your own payoff**, so you can assume Player 2 is also trying to maximize their own payoff.

So we look for a symmetric equilibrium.

---

But let’s first try to see what’s best for you.

Suppose you consider mixing A1 and A2.

Note: **A1 gives you 3 no matter what P2 does.**

A2 gives you:
- 3 if P2 plays A0 or A1
- 5 if P2 plays A2

So A2 is better than A1 **only if P2 plays A2**.

But if you believe P2 is rational, will P2 play A2?

Let’s analyze Player 2’s incentives.

By symmetry, Player 2’s payoff table (from their perspective) is:

| P2\P1 | A0       | A1       | A2       |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 5        | 3        | 3        |
| **A1**  | 0        | 3        | 3        |
| **A2**  | 0        | 3        | 5        |

So for Player 2:
- A0: gets 5 if P1 plays A0, but only 3 if P1 plays A1 or A2
- A1: always gets 3
- A2: gets 3 if P1 plays A0 or A1, and 5 if P1 plays A2

So for Player 2:
- A1 gives **guaranteed 3** → safe
- A0 gives 5 only if P1 plays A0, otherwise (A1, A0) gives 3, (A2, A0) gives 3
- A2 gives 5 only if P1 plays A2, otherwise 3

So key: **if P1 plays A0**, and P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 5
But if P1 plays A0, P2 playing A1 or A2 → gets 3

So rational Player 2 would **only play A0 if they believe P1 will play A0**.

But if P1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 5 by playing A0, 3 by A1, 3 by A2 → so better to play A0.

But if P1 does NOT play A0 (i.e., plays A1 or A2), then P2 gets 3 from A0, 3 from A1, 3 from A2 — so again, indifferent.

Wait: if P1 plays A1:
- P2 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → P2 gets 0
- P2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → 3
- P2 plays A2 → (A1, A2) → only P2 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → so P2 plays A1 → so (A1, A1) → 3

So:
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets:
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 3
  - A2: 3
  → best to play A1 or A2, not A0.

Similarly, if P1 plays A2:
- P2 plays A0 → (A2, A0): P1 delegates, so mediator plays A1, P2 plays A0 → outcome (A1, A0) → P2 gets 0
- P2 plays A1 → (A2, A1): P1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → P2 gets 3
- P2 plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → P2 gets 5

So if P1 plays A2, P2 gets:
- A0: 0
- A1: 3
- A2: 5 → best to play A2

So in summary, Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 best response: A0 (gets 5) > 3
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 best response: A1 or A2 (get 3) > A0 (get 0)
- If P1 plays A2 → P2 best response: A2 (gets 5) > A1 or A0

But now we can look for a symmetric equilibrium.

Assume both players use the same mixed strategy: play A0 with prob p, A1 with q, A2 with r, where p + q + r = 1.

But maybe we can assume symmetry and find a fixed point.

Alternative idea: rough guess.

Suppose both players randomize between A1 and A2, but not A0.

Why? Because A0 is risky — if you play A0 and the other plays A1 or A2, you get 0 or 0.

But if you play A2 and the other plays A2, you get 5 — good.
If the other plays A1, you get 3 — same as A1.
But if the other plays A0, you get 3 — same as A1.

But if you play A0 and the other plays A0, you get 5 — great.
But if the other plays anything else, you get 0.

So A0 is high-risk, high-reward only if the other plays A0.

But if Player 2 is rational, and if you play A0 with positive probability, P2 might want to mimic and play A0 for 5.

But then again, if you play A0, it’s good for P2 to play A0.

But if both play A0 → (5,5) → good.

But if they both play A2 → (5,5) → also good.

So (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) are both equilibria?

Let’s check.

---

### Step 6: Check for Nash Equilibria

#### Try (A0, A0): both play A0

- P1: gets 5
- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 3 (since P2 plays A0) → worse
- If P1 deviates to A2: only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → P1 gets 3 → worse
- So no incentive to deviate → **Nash equilibrium**

#### Try (A2, A2): both play A2

- 2 delegators → mediator plays A0
- So outcome: (A0, A0) → P1 gets 5
- If P1 deviates to A0: same thing — still (A0, A0) → still 5 → indifferent
- If P1 deviates to A1: (A1, A0) → P1 gets 3 < 5 → worse
- So **A2 is a best response** when P2 plays A2 (since A0 gives same, A1 worse) → so **Nash equilibrium**

So multiple equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) are both symmetric Nash equilibria.

But can we have a mixed strategy?

But we need to find a strategy that **maximizes your expected payoff**, assuming optimal play from the other player.

Since there are multiple equilibria, which one will happen?

In such cases, we often look for **risk-dominant** or **payoff-dominant** equilibria.

- (A0, A0): both get 5 — better than (A2, A2) which also gives 5, so **same payoff**.

But (A0, A0) is more efficient? No, both give (5,5)

But (A0, A0) is Pareto optimal.

But in (A2, A2), you are relying on the mediator, but you get same payoff.

But can we do better than 5?

No — 5 is the maximum possible payoff.

But let’s think: suppose you play A2 with some probability, and the other player plays A2 with some probability.

Then you get 5 only when both play A2.

But if you play A0, you get 5 only when the other plays A0.

So in both cases, you get 5 only when both coordinate on same action.

But here's the insight: **if you can coordinate on A2, you get 5, no risk**.

But can you get a better **expected payoff** than 5?

No — 5 is maximum.

But perhaps you can get **expected payoff higher than 5**? No — 5 is max.

Wait — no, you can only get 0, 3, or 5.

So expected payoff is at most 5.

Now, **if you play A2 with probability 1**, and you assume the other player is rational, they will consider their best response.

But if you play A2, P2 gets:
- 0 if plays A0
- 3 if plays A1
- 5 if plays A2

So P2's best response is A2.

So if you play A2, P2 plays A2 → outcome: (A2, A2) → (A0, A0) → you get 5

So if you play A2 with probability 1, P2 best response is A2 → you get 5

Similarly, if you play A0 with probability 1, P2 best response is A0 → you get 5

So in **both** pure equilibria, you get 5.

So you can **guarantee** 5 if you play either pure strategy.

But is there a mixed strategy that gives **higher than 5**? No.

But can we get **expected payoff higher than 5**? No.

But wait — what if you play a mix that makes P2 indifferent? But you want to **maximize your payoff**, not

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

response:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)**

We are in a symmetric two-player game, with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1's payoff, with Player 2's action on the column):

|          | A0 (P2) | A1 (P2) |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **A0 (P1)** | 5       | 0       |
| **A1 (P1)** | 3       | 3       |

Similarly for Player 2.

This is a **coordination game with a preference to coordinate on A0**, but there's also some asymmetry: if you play A0 and the other plays A1, you get 0 (very bad), whereas if you play A1 and the other plays A0, you get 3 (better than 0), but both get 3 if both play A1.

So:
- (A0, A0): (5,5) — best outcome
- (A0, A1): (0,3) — bad for you
- (A1, A0): (3,0) — bad for others
- (A1, A1): (3,3) — acceptable, but not optimal

In standard game theory, the Nash equilibria of this game are:
- (A0, A0) — pure strategy: both pick A0, gives 5 each
- (A1, A1) — pure strategy: both get 3
- Mixed strategy equilibrium where each player randomizes to make the other indifferent.

But note: there's a **high incentive to coordinate on A0**, due to the high reward.

---

### **Step 2: Introduce the Delegation Mechanism**

Now, we have a **new action: A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**.

If you delegate, **the mediator plays for you**, based on **how many players have delegated**.

From the description:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays A0
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays A0

So regardless of whether 1 or 2 players delegate, the mediator plays **A0**.

So:
- If you delegate and the other does not: you get A0 played for you
- If you delegate and the other also delegates: you still get A0 played for you

**Important**: The mediator **always plays A0**, no matter how many delegate.

Thus, delegating to the mediator **guarantees** that your action is A0.

This is **very powerful** — it removes any risk of playing A1, and ensures your action is A0.

But: delegation is **not free**. The mediator executes based on the number of players who delegate — but in this case, the outcome is **always A0**.

So, delegating is like a **commitment device** to play A0.

---

### **Step 3: Evaluate the Payoffs Based on Actions**

Let’s consider what happens in each case:

Let’s suppose you choose:
- A0: you play A0
- A1: you play A1
- A2: you delegate → mediator plays A0

Same for the other player.

We need to choose a **mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2.

Let’s define:
- p = probability you play A0
- q = probability you play A1
- r = probability you play A2
- Then p + q + r = 100

Similarly, let’s suppose the other player uses a strategy (p', q', r') with p'+q'+r'=100.

But since we are trying to **maximize our expected payoff**, and the game is symmetric, we should consider whether a symmetric equilibrium or a best response makes sense.

But note: **you are optimizing for your own payoff**.

Let’s analyze **what happens when you delegate (A2)**:
- You get A0 played for you, regardless of what the other player does.
- So your action is effectively A0.
- So your payoff depends only on the other player’s action.

Let’s compute your expected payoff if you delegate (A2), **assuming the other player uses some strategy**.

Let’s suppose the other player uses (p', q', r').

Then their actual action is:
- A0 with probability p'
- A1 with probability q'
- A2 (delegate) → so they get A0 played for them.

So from **your perspective**, the other player’s effective action is:
- A0 with probability (p' + r')  [if they play A0 or delegate]
- A1 with probability q'  [if they play A1]

So if you delegate:
- You play A0
- Other plays A0 with prob (p' + r'), A1 with prob q'

Then your expected payoff when you delegate is:

> E[Delegating] = (p' + r') * 5 + q' * 0 = 5(p' + r')

Now, what if **you play A0** yourself?

Then you play A0.

Other player:
- Plays A0 with prob (p' + r')
- Plays A1 with prob q'

Then your payoff:
> E[A0] = (p' + r') * 5 + q' * 0 = 5(p' + r')

Same as delegating!

So **if you play A0 or choose to delegate (A2), your effective action is A0**, and your expected payoff is **the same** in both cases: 5 * P(other plays A0) + 0 * P(other plays A1)

So: **A0 and A2 yield identical expected payoffs** in terms of your action profile.

But wait — is there any **difference**?
- You might prefer to avoid the risk of playing A1
- But since you are choosing a mixed strategy, and you’re in control, you can use delegation to **ensure** you don’t play A1
- However, since both A0 and A2 give the same outcome in terms of action (A0), and same expected payoff, they are **strategically equivalent** in this setup

But: **can we use A2 to coordinate better?**

Suppose both players delegate → each gets A0 played for them → both get 5 → outcome (A0, A0) → 5 each.

If both play A0 → (A0, A0) → 5 each.

If one plays A0 and other plays A1 → 0 vs 3.

So **only if both coordinate on A0**, you get 5.

But if one delegates and the other doesn’t, the delegate gets A0, the non-delegate may play A1.

So: **delegation only guarantees A0 for the delegator**.

Now here's the key: **delegation is a commitment to A0, but it does not influence the other player’s choice**.

But: if you delegate, you **cannot** play A1.

That may be a strategic advantage if you can use it to **induce the other player to play A0** (i.e., if you commit to A0, the other may want to follow to get 5 instead of 0).

But in this game, we are choosing **simultaneously**, so no signaling or sequential moves.

Also: the mediator **does not care about the other player** — it just plays A0 no matter how many delegates.

So delegation **does not improve coordination** beyond just playing A0 — unless it helps convince the other player to play A0.

But since we don’t have communication, and everything is simultaneous, **delegation doesn’t give any extra leverage**.

So in this setting, **A0 and A2 are equivalent** in terms of:
- Action outcome: A0
- Expected payoff: both give same expected payoff when the other player plays a certain mix

Therefore, from your perspective, **A0 and A2 are interchangeable** if you’re getting the same expected payoff.

But: using A2 means you **cannot play A1**, so you are **not exposed to the risk of getting 0 points if the other plays A1**.

But since you can control your mixed strategy, you can **choose not to play A1 at all**, which seems smarter.

Wait — let’s think differently.

Suppose you play A1.

Then your action is A1.

The other player may:
- Play A0 → you get 3
- Play A1 → you get 3

So no matter what, **you get at least 3** if you play A1.

But if you play A0 or delegate, your payoff depends on the other player:
- If they play A0 → you get 5
- If they play A1 → you get 0

So playing A1 guarantees **at least 3**, while playing A0 or A2 risks getting 0.

So **A1 is safer** than A0/A2 **if there’s a risk that the other plays A1**.

But in symmetric equilibrium, both players might want to avoid the risk.

So let’s find **Nash equilibria**.

---

### **Step 4: Find Best Response Strategies**

Let’s suppose the other player plays a mixed strategy:
- P(A0) = x
- P(A1) = y
- P(A2) = z
- x + y + z = 1

But note: **A2 leads to A0**, so from your perspective:
- P(other effectively plays A0) = x + z
- P(other plays A1) = y

Now, compute your expected payoff for each of your actions:

1. **Play A0**:
   - You play A0
   - Other plays A0 with prob (x+z), A1 with prob y
   - Payoff: 5(x+z) + 0*y = 5(x+z)

2. **Play A1**:
   - You play A1
   - Other plays A0: you get 3
   - Other plays A1: you get 3
   - Payoff: 3(x+z) + 3y = 3

3. **Play A2 (delegate)**:
   - You get A0 played for you
   - Same as playing A0: payoff = 5(x+z)

So:
- A0: 5(x+z)
- A1: 3
- A2: 5(x+z)

So A0 and A2 give same payoff.

You will choose:
- A0 or A2 if 5(x+z) > 3 → x+z > 0.6
- A1 if 5(x+z) < 3 → x+z < 0.6
- Indifferent if x+z = 0.6

Now, suppose both players are symmetric. Let's assume symmetry: both use same strategy.

Let the other player use:
- P(A0) = a
- P(A1) = b
- P(A2) = c
- a + b + c = 1

Then x+z = a + c

Your best response:
- Play A0 or A2 if a + c > 0.6
- Play A1 if a + c < 0.6
- Indifferent if a + c = 0.6

Now, in a **symmetric Nash equilibrium**, we want your strategy to be best response to theirs.

Let’s try to find such an equilibrium.

---

### **Try: Suppose both players use c > 0.6, so a + c > 0.6 → you prefer A0 or A2**

Then best response is to play A0 or A2 (since both give same payoff).

So in equilibrium, players **only use A0 and A2**, never A1.

Let the symmetric strategy be:
- P(A0) = a
- P(A2) = c
- P(A1) = 0
- a + c = 1

Then a + c = 1 > 0.6 → so best response is to play A0 or A2 → consistent.

Now, what is the equilibrium?

But: is there a better response?

You could play A0 or A2.

The other player also plays A0 or A2 → so effective action:
- A0 with prob (a + c) = 1
- A1 with prob 0

So if both always play A0 or A2 → then both act as A0 → both get (A0, A0) → 5 points

So expected payoff: 5

Now, is this stable?

Suppose a player deviates:
- Play A1: then they play A1, other plays A0 (prob 1) → so get 3 < 5 → not better
- So no incentive to deviate

So (A0, A2) mix with A1=0 is a Nash equilibrium.

But there are multiple such equilibria: any mix of A0 and A2 with A1=0.

But we are free to choose our own mixed strategy.

But we want **to maximize our point total**, so we want to choose a strategy that is best response to whatever the other player does.

But we don’t know what the other player does.

However, **we can assume** that the other player is also rational and will play a symmetric equilibrium strategy.

But the game may have **multiple equilibria**.

We need to pick a strategy that maximizes our **expected payoff under the assumption of symmetric rational play**.

But now, consider a different equilibrium: suppose both players play a **mixed strategy involving A1**.

Suppose in symmetric equilibrium, players play A1 with some positive probability.

Then a + c = P(other plays A0 effectively) < 1

Suppose a + c = 0.6 → then 5(a + c) = 3 → so A0 and A2 give 3, A1 gives 3 → so all actions give 3 → then any mix is best response.

So let’s try to find such a symmetric equilibrium.

Suppose both players use:
- P(A0) = a
- P(A1) = b
- P(A2) = c
- a + b + c = 1

Best response: if a + c > 0.6 → prefer A0/A2 → so to make them indifferent, require a + c = 0.6

Then:
- Payoff from A0/A2: 5 * 0.6 = 3
- Payoff from A1: 3
→ so all actions give 3 → any mix is best response

So we can have a symmetric equilibrium where **a + c = 0.6**, so P(other plays A0) = 0.6 → then all strategies give 3.

Then expected payoff is 3.

But in the previous equilibrium (both play A0 or A2 only), you get 5.

So **5 > 3**, so players would prefer the first equilibrium.

Moreover, the (A0, A2) only equilibrium gives **higher payoff**.

But: is this the only equilibrium?

Suppose one player plays only A0, other plays only A2.

Then you get A0, they get A0 → both get 5.

But can the other player deviate?

Suppose you play only A0, then other wants to play A0 or A2? That would give them 5. If they play A1, they get 3. So they won’t deviate.

Similarly, if they play only A2, you get 5, and if you play A0 or A2, you get 5; if you play A1, you get 3 → no incentive to deviate.

So **any strategy where both players play only A0 and A2 (no A1)** is an equilibrium, and gives **5 each**.

Also, if both players play only A0: that also gives 5 → equilibrium.

But A2 is equivalent to A0 in terms of outcome.

However, **A2 may be used to reduce the risk of making a mistake**, but in this case, since everything is strategic, it’s not needed.

Now, the key question is: **Can we do better than 5?**

No, because maximum is 5.

But: **can we guarantee 5?** Only if we coordinate on (A0, A0)

But if we play A1, we can never get 5 — only 3.

So best outcome is 5 — we want to maximize chance of getting 5.

So to get 5, both players must have effective A0 actions.

So if **both players play A0 or A2**, then both get A0 → payoff 5.

If one plays A0 or A2, and other plays A1 → then we get 0 or 3 depending on who plays what.

So to ensure high payoff, we should avoid playing A1.

But what if the other player is irrational?

We are to **maximize our own expected points**, assuming the other player is rational and also trying to maximize their points.

So we can assume **both players aim for the symmetric equilibrium with highest payoff**, which is the pure coordination on A0 (via A0 or A2).

But is there a risk?

Suppose both players randomize between A0 and A2, but there's a chance one plays A1.

Then we might get 0.

But in equilibrium, if we **both avoid A1**, we can guarantee 5.

But what if the other player **uses a mixed strategy involving A1**?

For example, suppose the other player plays A1 with positive probability.

Then if we play A0 or A2, our payoff is 5 * P(other plays A0) = 5 * (1 - P(other plays A1))

So to maximize, we want to **minimize risk of the other playing A1**.

But we don't know what they do.

But since we are playing the game, and the other player is trying to maximize their own points, **they will avoid playing A1 unless forced**.

Because playing A1 gives at best 3, while if they play A0 or A2 and the other plays A0, they get 5.

So rational players have **no incentive to play A1**, because:
- If the other plays A0 (frequent), playing A1 gives 0 vs 3 — worse.
- If the other plays A1, playing A1 gives 3 vs 3 — same.
- So playing A1 gives **weakly lower payoff** unless the other is playing A1.

But only if the other is playing A1 with high probability, then it’s okay.

But since both players are symmetric, they **should coordinate on A0** to get 5.

So **the most rational choice is to not play A1**.

Thus, **both players will choose to play A0 or A2**, never A1.

Therefore, **playing A1 is a dominated strategy**.

Let’s verify: Suppose the other player plays only A0 and A2 (so P(A0 or A2) = 1, P(A1) = 0)

Then:
- If you play A0: get 5
- If you play A2: get 5
- If you play A1: get 3 → worse than 5

So A1 is strictly dominated by A0 and A2 **if the other player plays only A0 and A2**

But if the other player plays A1 with positive probability, then A0 and A2 give 5 * P(other plays A0), which could be less than 3 if P(other plays A0) < 0.6.

But if the other player is rational and we assume symmetry, they won’t play A1 unless forced.

But since A1 is dominated if the other is playing A0 or A2, and no one gains by playing A1, then **A1 should not be used in equilibrium**.

Hence, the **only reasonable equilibrium involves no A1**.

Therefore, **we should never play A1**.

So set **P(A1) = 0**

Now, between A0 and A2 — they are **equivalent** in payoff, and both yield A0.

So we can mix between them.

But: is there a reason to prefer one over the other?

The mediator only has power to commit to A0 — but since we can choose A0 directly, and the action is the same, **no difference**.

But — delegation might be useful if we want to **facilitate coordination**.

But in a symmetric game with no communication, delegation doesn’t change outcome.

So we can choose any mixture.

But to **maximize expected payoff**, we want to **get 5**, which happens whenever the other player also plays A0 or A2.

Since we **will not play A1**, P(A1) = 0

Then our expected payoff is 5 * P(other plays A0 or A2) = 5 * 1 (if they also avoid A1)

But if they play A1 with some probability, we get less.

But since we assume rational opponent, they won’t play A1.

So expected payoff is 5, regardless of how we mix between A0 and A2.

So we can choose any mixture with P(A1) = 0

But: we must choose a single strategy.

We can pick, for example, to **play A0 with 100%** — then if the other does the same, we get 5.

Or we can delegate: A2 with 100%.

But is there any **advantage to delegation**?

Only if it helps **coordinate** — for example, if the other player sees that we delegated, they might be more likely to play A0.

But there’s **no signaling** — actions are chosen simultaneously and only outcomes are visible.

So no communication occurs.

Therefore, **no difference**.

So we can pick any mixture of A0 and A2, with A1 = 0.

But to **maximize expected points**, and since we can’t do better than 5, and we can only get 5 if the other doesn’t play A1, and they won’t, we can choose:

- A0: 100%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 0%

Or:
- A0: 0%
- A1: 0%
- A2: 100%

Or any mix.

But is there a reason to mix?

Suppose the other player might use a random strategy.

But since both A0 and A2 give same payoff and same action, mixing gives no benefit.

So best to **avoid randomness**.

But the question is: **what should we do?**

We want to **maximize expected points**, and we expect the other player to be rational, so they will not use A1.

Therefore, we should **not use A1**, since it’s strictly dominated.

Therefore, **option A1 should have probability 0**.

Now, between A0 and A2: both are equally good.

But **delegation is not free** — but in this case, it’s just a way to commit.

There is no cost, so we can delegate.

But to choose one, we might prefer **A2 = delegate**, because:
- It **forces** us not to play A1
- Even if we mistakenly want to play A1, we can’t — delegation acts as a commitment device
- This might help **in games with learning or repeated rounds**, but here it’s one round

But in this single round, since we are choosing a mixed strategy, we can just set A1 to 0.

But let’s compare:

- If we play **A0**: we get A0
- If we play **A2**: we get A0

Same outcome.

But: **by delegating, we make it impossible for us to play A1**, which protects us from mistakes.

But since we are rational and setting the strategy, we can just choose P(A1)=0.

So no advantage.

But the problem is: **in the output, we need to assign probabilities to A0, A1, A2**

We must pick one.

Now: **which one gives higher expected payoff?**

None — they are equal.

But suppose we think the other player **might play A1**?

But why would they? It gives only 3, while A0 gives 5 unless they are playing A1.

So if they are rational, they won’t.

But if we are risk-averse, we might prefer to delegate.

But the objective is to **maximize expected points**, not minimize risk.

So both give same expected payoff.

But here’s a **key insight**: in the **delegation mechanism**, **if you delegate, you are guaranteed A0**, but **if you play A0**, you might be mistaken — but no, we choose the probability.

No difference.

But: **what if the other player is also delegated?** But still, both get A0 → same as both play A0.

So outcome is identical.

Therefore, **no difference at all**.

So we can choose any combination of A0 and A2, as long as A1 = 0.

But to be safe and **avoid A1 entirely**, we should not play it.

Now — the problem says: “the mediator was proposed by Player 1 and selected via approval voting”

So it exists, and we can use it.

But **should we use it?**

Only if it helps.

But since **A2 and A0 are equivalent**, and A2 is safer (prevents us from playing A1), but since we can choose P(A1)=0, it’s not necessary.

But in the context of decision-making, **delegation can be a signal**.

But again, no communication.

So the best we can do is to **set A1 = 0**, and **assign all probability to A0 and A2**.

But which one?

Let’s think about **coordination**

Suppose both players delegate — then both get A0 → (5,5)

If both play A0 → same

But if one delegates, other plays A0 → same

So no issue.

But: **if both players delegate, the mediator plays A0**, which is what we want.

So no problem.

But: **if we delegate, we are not playing A1, which might be seen as trust**.

But again, no communication.

So **we can delegate 100%**

But is there any reason not to?

Suppose the other player sees that we delegated — might think we are trying to coordinate.

But since it’s simultaneous, they don't see our choice.

So **no effect**.

Therefore, **the strategy should be:**

- P(A1) = 0
- P(A0) + P(A2) = 100

But which split?

To maximize expected point, same.

But: **perhaps we should delegate to help with coordination in repeated games** — but this is a one-shot game.

So **we can choose either**.

But let’s consider the **exact wording**:

> "If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it."

And it says: "you have the option to delegate"

But also, **your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2**

So we must assign non-zero probability to A0, A1, A2? No — the instruction says “include probability for all actions”, but then says “values must sum to 100” — but it doesn’t say all must be positive.

But in constraints: “Keys must be the action names exactly as given.” — so we must have keys for A0, A1, A2.

But values can be 0.

For example, we can have {"A0": 100, "A1": 0, "A2": 0}

That’s valid.

But is there a **best choice**?

Let’s reconsider: if both players delegate, we get (A0, A0) → 5 each.

But if only one delegates, still (A0, A0)

But if neither delegates, and both play A0 — same.

No difference.

**But here’s a twist**: suppose the other player is **not rational** and plays A1 out of spite.

Then if we play A0, and they play A1 → we get 0.

If we delegate, we still get A0 → so we still get 0.

Same.

So no difference.

Therefore, **no matter what**, if the other plays A1, we get 0.

Only if they play A0 or A2, we get 5.

So our expected payoff depends only on whether the other player plays A0 or A2.

To maximize, we want to coordinate with them.

But since we cannot communicate, and we are rational, we should **avoid A1 ourselves**, so we can’t be the cause of low payoff.

So **set P(A1) = 0**

Now, for A0 and A2 — **we should use delegation** to **ensure** we don’t accidentally play A1, but since P(A1)=0, it’s not needed.

But **choosing A2 = delegate** has no downside.

But perhaps **delegation is a way to express intention to coordinate** — but again, no communication.

So I think the **optimal strategy is to never play A1**, and choose between A0 and A2.

But to pick one, let’s look at the **payoff when we delegate**.

Wait — is there a case where delegate is better?

Suppose the other player is playing A1 with high probability.

Then:
- If you play A0: you get 0
- If you play A1: you get 3
- If you play A2: you get 0

So A2 gives 0, same as A0.

Still worse than A1.

But if they are playing A1, rational players would not do that.

So not a concern.

Therefore, **in equilibrium, A1 should not be played by anyone**.

So the only rational strategy is to play only A0 and A2.

Now, which to choose? We can choose **A2 = 100%** to ensure we don't play A1 by accident.

But since it's a mixed strategy, we are defining probabilities, so we can set P(A1)=0.

But to be safe, **delegation is a commitment to A0**, which might be psychologically helpful, but not necessary.

Given that delegation has **no cost** and **guarantees** A0, and A0 has no cost, both are equivalent.

But **let’s notice**: the mediator plays A0 if 1 or 2 players delegate, so it’s always A0.

But if you play A0, you are playing A0.

So no difference.

However, **in the long run**, delegation might be useful if there are repeated games or if the mediator is trusted.

But here, single round.

So **we can choose any mix of A0 and A2, with A1=0**.

But to pick one, and since the problem is from Player 1's perspective, and the mediator was **proposed by Player 1**, perhaps **choosing to delegate is more appropriate**.

But not necessarily.

Alternatively, perhaps **delegation should be used to reduce the risk of exposure**, but again, no risk.

Final decision:

- Set A1 to 0
- Set A0 and A2 to some values that sum to 100

But which?

Let’s suppose we set **A2 = 100%** — delegate entirely.

Why? Because:
- It ensures you play A0
- It might be a way to coordinate with others who also delegate
- It is safe

But since both are equivalent, it’s fine.

But is there a case where delegating is strictly better?

No.

But there's a subtle point: if you play A0, you are choosing A0.

If you delegate, you are choosing A2.

The mediator is anonymous — users don't know who delegated.

But still.

After careful analysis, the **best strategy is to never play A1**, and since A0 and A2 are equivalent, we can choose one.

But to maximize expected points, and since there is no downside to delegation, **we can delegate 100%**.

But let’s consider: if we delegate, and the other player also delegates, you both get A0 → 5 highlights.

Same as if both played A0.

So no difference.

So I think the optimal strategy is to **play A2 with 100% probability**.

But is there any reason to play A0?

No.

But let’s go back to the best response.

Assume the other player plays A2 with high probability.

Then P(other plays A0) = 1

So your best response is A0 or A2 (both give 5)

If you play A1, you get 3 < 5

So A0 or A2 is better.

So you can play A2.

But also A0.

But delegates are always A0, so A2 is fine.

So to be safe and ensure coordination, we can delegate.

Moreover, **in the twist**, we are told that the mediator was selected, so it is available.

So **use it**.

Therefore, final strategy: delegate 100%.

JSON:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

But what if the other player doesn't delegate? Then they might play A0 or A1.

But if they play A0, we get 5.

If they play A1, we get 0.

But if we play A0, we get 0.

Same.

No difference.

So delegation is optimal.

Alternatively, could we **mix**?

But no advantage.

So I think the answer is to delegate 100%.

But let’s see if playing a mix helps.

Suppose we play A0 with 50%, A2 with 50%, A1 with 0.

Then we are equally likely to play A0 or delegate — both result in A0.

So same as playing A0 with 100%.

No benefit.

So to simplify, and because delegation is available, **delegate 100%**.

Final answer:

{"A0": 0, "A1": 0, "A2": 100}

Setup:
You are playing a decision-making game with another player.
Your objective is to maximize your total points received in the game described in length below.

Actions available to each player:
- A0
- A1

Basic game rules:
1. You and the other player each choose a probability for each action, simultaneously.
2. After both decisions are locked in, the final action will be drawn from the probability distributions.
3. Both players receive the points specified in the payoff description below.

Payoff description:
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A0: you get 5 points, the other player gets 5 points.
	- If you choose A0 and the other player chooses A1: you get 0 points, the other player gets 3 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A0: you get 3 points, the other player gets 0 points.
	- If you choose A1 and the other player chooses A1: you get 3 points, the other player gets 3 points.

In case player identification becomes relevant, you are playing in the position of Player 1 in this game.

Here is the twist:
On top of the original game rules, you have the option to delegate your move to a mediator.
If you choose to delegate, the mediator will play an action for you based on how many players have delegated to it.
You can also choose to act independently.

The available mediator was proposed by Player 2 and selected via approval voting among the players. Here is what the mediator would do for the players that delegate to it:
	• If 1 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A1.
	• If 2 player(s) delegate to the mediator, it will play action A0.

Consider A2 as an additional action "Delegate to Mediator". Your final mixed strategy should include probability for all actions A0, A1, ..., A2.

Your previous response was:
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)

We are playing a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.

Payoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):

|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |
| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |

This is a modified version of a coordination game with a twist. Let's analyze the Nash equilibria of this base game first.

- If both play A0: (5,5) — high payoff
- If you play A0, opponent plays A1: you get 0, they get 3
- If you play A1, opponent plays A0: you get 3, they get 0
- If both play A1: (3,3)

So:
- (A0, A0) is a clear Pareto optimal and mutual best response.
- But if you fear the other will play A1, you might prefer A1 to avoid getting 0.
- (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium because neither player benefits from deviating alone (if the other plays A1, you get 3 either way).
- (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium: if the other plays A0, you get 5 by playing A0 and only 3 by playing A1 → best to play A0.

So there are **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). There may also be a mixed strategy equilibrium.

But now comes the twist: **we can delegate to a mediator**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Mediator

You have a new action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**

The mediator’s behavior:
- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**
- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**

Note: You are Player 1. The other player (Player 2) is also choosing their action, possibly delegating.

So we need to consider the **strategic interaction** between:
- Your decision: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)
- Player 2's decision: A0, A1, or A2

But since you are trying to **maximize your own expected payoff**, and you are Player 1, you need to think about what distribution over actions you should choose, considering Player 2’s potential actions.

But here’s the catch: **the mediator acts based on how many players delegated** — not who they are. So the outcome depends on the **number** of players delegating.

Let’s list all possible cases based on how many players delegate.

---

### Step 3: Enumerate Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation

Let’s consider the joint actions between you (P1) and Player 2.

We’ll analyze the outcome (your payoff) in each scenario.

---

#### Case 1: Neither delegates (P1: A0 or A1, P2: A0 or A1)
- No one delegates → mediator not used
- So both play their chosen actions directly.
- This reduces to the base game.

You choose A0 or A1, same as P2.
- (A0, A0): you get 5
- (A0, A1): you get 0
- (A1, A0): you get 3
- (A1, A1): you get 3

(We’ll come back to optimize over this — but note that A0 and A1 are not available here unless you directly choose them.)

But wait: if you **don’t delegate**, you choose A0 or A1 directly.

So “not delegating” means you play A0 or A1 with some probability.

So we have to model this as a game where each player chooses between:
- Play A0
- Play A1
- Delegate (A2)

So the space is 3×3 = 9 possible combinations.

Let’s go through all 9.

---

### Step 4: Full Payoff Table (Player 1’s Payoff in Each Case)

Let’s define:

- P1's action: A0, A1, A2
- P2's action: A0, A1, A2

Then compute P1’s **expected payoff** based on:
- Who delegates
- How many delegates
- Mediator’s action

Let’s list all 9 possibilities.

---

#### 1. P1: A0, P2: A0
- No delegation → both play A0
- Payoff: **5**

#### 2. P1: A0, P2: A1
- No delegation → (A0, A1)
- Payoff: **0**

#### 3. P1: A0, P2: A2
- P1 plays A0 directly; P2 delegates
- So only 1 player (P2) delegates → mediator plays A1
- P1 plays A0
- P2's effective action: A1
- So outcome: (A0, A1)
- P1 gets **0**

#### 4. P1: A1, P2: A0
- No delegation → (A1, A0)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 5. P1: A1, P2: A1
- No delegation → (A1, A1)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 6. P1: A1, P2: A2
- P1 plays A1, P2 delegates
- Only P2 delegates → 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**
- So P2’s effective action: A1
- P1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 7. P1: A2, P2: A0
- P1 delegates, P2 plays A0
- 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**
- So P1’s effective action: A1
- P2 plays A0
- Outcome: (A1, A0)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 8. P1: A2, P2: A1
- P1 delegates, P2 plays A1
- 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**
- P1’s action: A1 (via mediator)
- P2 plays A1
- Outcome: (A1, A1)
- P1 gets **3**

#### 9. P1: A2, P2: A2
- Both delegate → 2 delegators → mediator plays **A0**
- So P1’s action: A0
- P2’s action: A0
- Outcome: (A0, A0)
- P1 gets **5**

---

### Step 5: Summarize P1’s Payoff in Each Scenario

| P1\P2 | A0       | A1       | A2       |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 5        | 0        | 0        |
| **A1**  | 3        | 3        | 3        |
| **A2**  | 3        | 3        | 5        |

Interesting!

So:
- If you play A0, your payoff depends on P2:
  - A0 → 5
  - A1 → 0
  - A2 → 0
- If you play A1, you always get 3 (regardless of what P2 does)
- If you play A2, you get:
  - 3 if P2 plays A0 or A1
  - 5 if P2 plays A2

So A2 is **only better than A1** when P2 also delegates.

But if P2 delegates, you get 5 (vs 3 if you play A1), so it's strictly better.

But you don’t know what P2 will do — this is a strategic choice.

---

Now the key insight: We need to **choose a mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2 to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming Player 2 is also rational and choosing their own best response.

But since you are the only one to submit the strategy, and we assume both players are rational, we might look for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.

But the game is symmetric? Let's see.

Wait: is it symmetric? Not exactly — you are told Player 2 proposed the mediator, but since it was approved by all (and there are only two players), it makes sense. But the **mediator’s behavior** is symmetric — it only depends on the number of delegators.

Also, the payoff table is symmetric.

So the game is symmetric. So we can look for a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

But you’re asking to **maximize your own payoff**, so you can assume Player 2 is also trying to maximize their own payoff.

So we look for a symmetric equilibrium.

---

But let’s first try to see what’s best for you.

Suppose you consider mixing A1 and A2.

Note: **A1 gives you 3 no matter what P2 does.**

A2 gives you:
- 3 if P2 plays A0 or A1
- 5 if P2 plays A2

So A2 is better than A1 **only if P2 plays A2**.

But if you believe P2 is rational, will P2 play A2?

Let’s analyze Player 2’s incentives.

By symmetry, Player 2’s payoff table (from their perspective) is:

| P2\P1 | A0       | A1       | A2       |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 5        | 3        | 3        |
| **A1**  | 0        | 3        | 3        |
| **A2**  | 0        | 3        | 5        |

So for Player 2:
- A0: gets 5 if P1 plays A0, but only 3 if P1 plays A1 or A2
- A1: always gets 3
- A2: gets 3 if P1 plays A0 or A1, and 5 if P1 plays A2

So for Player 2:
- A1 gives **guaranteed 3** → safe
- A0 gives 5 only if P1 plays A0, otherwise (A1, A0) gives 3, (A2, A0) gives 3
- A2 gives 5 only if P1 plays A2, otherwise 3

So key: **if P1 plays A0**, and P2 plays A0 → P2 gets 5
But if P1 plays A0, P2 playing A1 or A2 → gets 3

So rational Player 2 would **only play A0 if they believe P1 will play A0**.

But if P1 plays A0, Player 2 gets 5 by playing A0, 3 by A1, 3 by A2 → so better to play A0.

But if P1 does NOT play A0 (i.e., plays A1 or A2), then P2 gets 3 from A0, 3 from A1, 3 from A2 — so again, indifferent.

Wait: if P1 plays A1:
- P2 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → P2 gets 0
- P2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → 3
- P2 plays A2 → (A1, A2) → only P2 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → so P2 plays A1 → so (A1, A1) → 3

So:
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 gets:
  - A0: 0
  - A1: 3
  - A2: 3
  → best to play A1 or A2, not A0.

Similarly, if P1 plays A2:
- P2 plays A0 → (A2, A0): P1 delegates, so mediator plays A1, P2 plays A0 → outcome (A1, A0) → P2 gets 0
- P2 plays A1 → (A2, A1): P1 delegates → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → P2 gets 3
- P2 plays A2 → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → outcome (A0, A0) → P2 gets 5

So if P1 plays A2, P2 gets:
- A0: 0
- A1: 3
- A2: 5 → best to play A2

So in summary, Player 2’s best response:
- If P1 plays A0 → P2 best response: A0 (gets 5) > 3
- If P1 plays A1 → P2 best response: A1 or A2 (get 3) > A0 (get 0)
- If P1 plays A2 → P2 best response: A2 (gets 5) > A1 or A0

But now we can look for a symmetric equilibrium.

Assume both players use the same mixed strategy: play A0 with prob p, A1 with q, A2 with r, where p + q + r = 1.

But maybe we can assume symmetry and find a fixed point.

Alternative idea: rough guess.

Suppose both players randomize between A1 and A2, but not A0.

Why? Because A0 is risky — if you play A0 and the other plays A1 or A2, you get 0 or 0.

But if you play A2 and the other plays A2, you get 5 — good.
If the other plays A1, you get 3 — same as A1.
But if the other plays A0, you get 3 — same as A1.

But if you play A0 and the other plays A0, you get 5 — great.
But if the other plays anything else, you get 0.

So A0 is high-risk, high-reward only if the other plays A0.

But if Player 2 is rational, and if you play A0 with positive probability, P2 might want to mimic and play A0 for 5.

But then again, if you play A0, it’s good for P2 to play A0.

But if both play A0 → (5,5) → good.

But if they both play A2 → (5,5) → also good.

So (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) are both equilibria?

Let’s check.

---

### Step 6: Check for Nash Equilibria

#### Try (A0, A0): both play A0

- P1: gets 5
- If P1 deviates to A1: gets 3 (since P2 plays A0) → worse
- If P1 deviates to A2: only 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → P1 plays A1, P2 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → P1 gets 3 → worse
- So no incentive to deviate → **Nash equilibrium**

#### Try (A2, A2): both play A2

- 2 delegators → mediator plays A0
- So outcome: (A0, A0) → P1 gets 5
- If P1 deviates to A0: same thing — still (A0, A0) → still 5 → indifferent
- If P1 deviates to A1: (A1, A0) → P1 gets 3 < 5 → worse
- So **A2 is a best response** when P2 plays A2 (since A0 gives same, A1 worse) → so **Nash equilibrium**

So multiple equilibria: (A0, A0) and (A2, A2) are both symmetric Nash equilibria.

But can we have a mixed strategy?

But we need to find a strategy that **maximizes your expected payoff**, assuming optimal play from the other player.

Since there are multiple equilibria, which one will happen?

In such cases, we often look for **risk-dominant** or **payoff-dominant** equilibria.

- (A0, A0): both get 5 — better than (A2, A2) which also gives 5, so **same payoff**.

But (A0, A0) is more efficient? No, both give (5,5)

But (A0, A0) is Pareto optimal.

But in (A2, A2), you are relying on the mediator, but you get same payoff.

But can we do better than 5?

No — 5 is the maximum possible payoff.

But let’s think: suppose you play A2 with some probability, and the other player plays A2 with some probability.

Then you get 5 only when both play A2.

But if you play A0, you get 5 only when the other plays A0.

So in both cases, you get 5 only when both coordinate on same action.

But here's the insight: **if you can coordinate on A2, you get 5, no risk**.

But can you get a better **expected payoff** than 5?

No — 5 is maximum.

But perhaps you can get **expected payoff higher than 5**? No — 5 is max.

Wait — no, you can only get 0, 3, or 5.

So expected payoff is at most 5.

Now, **if you play A2 with probability 1**, and you assume the other player is rational, they will consider their best response.

But if you play A2, P2 gets:
- 0 if plays A0
- 3 if plays A1
- 5 if plays A2

So P2's best response is A2.

So if you play A2, P2 plays A2 → outcome: (A2, A2) → (A0, A0) → you get 5

So if you play A2 with probability 1, P2 best response is A2 → you get 5

Similarly, if you play A0 with probability 1, P2 best response is A0 → you get 5

So in **both** pure equilibria, you get 5.

So you can **guarantee** 5 if you play either pure strategy.

But is there a mixed strategy that gives **higher than 5**? No.

But can we get **expected payoff higher than 5**? No.

But wait — what if you play a mix that makes P2 indifferent? But you want to **maximize your payoff**, not

That response is INVALID because: No JSON object found in the response 'Let\'s break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base Game (Without Delegation)\n\nWe are playing a symmetric two-player game with actions A0 and A1.\n\nPayoff matrix (Player 1 vs Player 2):\n\n|               | P2: A0 | P2: A1 |\n|---------------|--------|--------|\n| **P1: A0**    | (5,5)  | (0,3)  |\n| **P1: A1**    | (3,0)  | (3,3)  |\n\nThis is a modified version of a coordination game with a twist. Let\'s analyze the Nash equilibria of this base game first.\n\n- If both play A0: (5,5) — high payoff\n- If you play A0, opponent plays A1: you get 0, they get 3\n- If you play A1, opponent plays A0: you get 3, they get 0\n- If both play A1: (3,3)\n\nSo:\n- (A0, A0) is a clear Pareto optimal and mutual best response.\n- But if you fear the other will play A1, you might prefer A1 to avoid getting 0.\n- (A1, A1) is a Nash equilibrium because neither player benefits from deviating alone (if the other plays A1, you get 3 either way).\n- (A0, A0) is also a Nash equilibrium: if the other plays A0, you get 5 by playing A0 and only 3 by playing A1 → best to play A0.\n\nSo there are **two pure Nash equilibria**: (A0, A0) and (A1, A1). There may also be a mixed strategy equilibrium.\n\nBut now comes the twist: **we can delegate to a mediator**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Mediator\n\nYou have a new action: **A2 = "Delegate to Mediator"**\n\nThe mediator’s behavior:\n- If **1 player** delegates → mediator plays **A1**\n- If **2 players** delegate → mediator plays **A0**\n\nNote: You are Player 1. The other player (Player 2) is also choosing their action, possibly delegating.\n\nSo we need to consider the **strategic interaction** between:\n- Your decision: A0, A1, or A2 (delegate)\n- Player 2\'s decision: A0, A1, or A2\n\nBut since you are trying to **maximize your own expected payoff**, and you are Player 1, you need to think about what distribution over actions you should choose, considering Player 2’s potential actions.\n\nBut here’s the catch: **the mediator acts based on how many players delegated** — not who they are. So the outcome depends on the **number** of players delegating.\n\nLet’s list all possible cases based on how many players delegate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate Possible Outcomes Based on Delegation\n\nLet’s consider the joint actions between you (P1) and Player 2.\n\nWe’ll analyze the outcome (your payoff) in each scenario.\n\n---\n\n#### Case 1: Neither delegates (P1: A0 or A1, P2: A0 or A1)\n- No one delegates → mediator not used\n- So both play their chosen actions directly.\n- This reduces to the base game.\n\nYou choose A0 or A1, same as P2.\n- (A0, A0): you get 5\n- (A0, A1): you get 0\n- (A1, A0): you get 3\n- (A1, A1): you get 3\n\n(We’ll come back to optimize over this — but note that A0 and A1 are not available here unless you directly choose them.)\n\nBut wait: if you **don’t delegate**, you choose A0 or A1 directly.\n\nSo “not delegating” means you play A0 or A1 with some probability.\n\nSo we have to model this as a game where each player chooses between:\n- Play A0\n- Play A1\n- Delegate (A2)\n\nSo the space is 3×3 = 9 possible combinations.\n\nLet’s go through all 9.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Full Payoff Table (Player 1’s Payoff in Each Case)\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- P1\'s action: A0, A1, A2\n- P2\'s action: A0, A1, A2\n\nThen compute P1’s **expected payoff** based on:\n- Who delegates\n- How many delegates\n- Mediator’s action\n\nLet’s list all 9 possibilities.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. P1: A0, P2: A0\n- No delegation → both play A0\n- Payoff: **5**\n\n#### 2. P1: A0, P2: A1\n- No delegation → (A0, A1)\n- Payoff: **0**\n\n#### 3. P1: A0, P2: A2\n- P1 plays A0 directly; P2 delegates\n- So only 1 player (P2) delegates → mediator plays A1\n- P1 plays A0\n- P2\'s effective action: A1\n- So outcome: (A0, A1)\n- P1 gets **0**\n\n#### 4. P1: A1, P2: A0\n- No delegation → (A1, A0)\n- P1 gets **3**\n\n#### 5. P1: A1, P2: A1\n- No delegation → (A1, A1)\n- P1 gets **3**\n\n#### 6. P1: A1, P2: A2\n- P1 plays A1, P2 delegates\n- Only P2 delegates → 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**\n- So P2’s effective action: A1\n- P1 plays A1 → outcome: (A1, A1)\n- P1 gets **3**\n\n#### 7. P1: A2, P2: A0\n- P1 delegates, P2 plays A0\n- 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**\n- So P1’s effective action: A1\n- P2 plays A0\n- Outcome: (A1, A0)\n- P1 gets **3**\n\n#### 8. P1: A2, P2: A1\n- P1 delegates, P2 plays A1\n- 1 delegator → mediator plays **A1**\n- P1’s action: A1 (via mediator)\n- P2 plays A1\n- Outcome: (A1, A1)\n- P1 gets **3**\n\n#### 9. P1: A2, P2: A2\n- Both delegate → 2 delegators → mediator plays **A0**\n- So P1’s action: A0\n- P2’s action: A0\n- Outcome: (A0, A0)\n- P1 gets **5**\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Summarize P1’s Payoff in Each Scenario\n\n| P1\\P2 | A0       | A1       | A2       |\n|-------|----------|----------|----------|\n| **A0**  | 5        | 0        | 0        |\n| **A1**  | 3        | 3        | 3        |\n| **A2**  | 3        | 3        | 5        |\n\nInteresting!\n\nSo:\n- If you play A0, your payoff depends on P2:\n  - A0 → 5\n  - A1 → 0\n  - A2 → 0\n- If you play A1, you always get 3 (regardless of what P2 does)\n- If you play A2, you get:\n  - 3 if P2 plays A0 or A1\n  - 5 if P2 plays A2\n\nSo A2 is **only better than A1** when P2 also delegates.\n\nBut if P2 delegates, you get 5 (vs 3 if you play A1), so it\'s strictly better.\n\nBut you don’t know what P2 will do — this is a strategic choice.\n\n---\n\nNow the key insight: We need to **choose a mixed strategy** over A0, A1, A2 to **maximize your expected payoff**, assuming Player 2 is also rational and choosing their own best response.\n\nBut since you are the only one to submit the strategy, and we assume both players are rational, we might look for a **Nash equilibrium** in mixed strategies.\n\nBut the game is symmetric?

Let's solve this step by step to maximize your expected points in the game.

### Step 1: Understand the Game and Payoffs

You are Player 1. There are three actions:  
- **A0**: Play A0 directly  
- **A1**: Play A1 directly  
- **A2**: Delegate to the mediator

The mediator plays:
- **A1** if exactly one player delegates
- **A0** if both players delegate

Payoff to Player 1 (you) in each combination:

| P1 \ P2 | A0       | A1       | A2       |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **A0**  | 5        | 0        | 0        |
| **A1**  | 3        | 3        | 3        |
| **A2**  | 3        | 3        | 5        |

Explanation:
- (A2, A2): both delegate → mediator plays A0 → both play A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 5
- (A2, A1): you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1; P2 plays A1 → (A1, A1) → you get 3
- (A2, A0): you delegate → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → you play A1; P2 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 3
- (A0, A0): both play A0 → (5,5) → you get 5
- (A0, A1): you play A0, P2 plays A1 → (A0, A1) → you get 0
- (A0, A2): you play A0, P2 delegates → 1 delegate → mediator plays A1 → P2 plays A1 → (A0, A1) → you get 0
- (A1, A0): you play A1, P2 plays A0 → (A1, A0) → you get 3
- (A1, A1): both play A1 → (3,3) → you get 3

So your payoff:
- A0: risky — only good if P2 plays A0 (get 5), otherwise get 0
- A1: safe — always get 3
- A2: gets 3 unless P2 also plays A2, in which case you get 5

### Step 2: Best Response Analysis

We assume the other player (P2) is rational and will choose a best response to your strategy.

Let’s suppose you play a mixed strategy:  
- Play A0 with probability p  
- Play A1 with probability q  
- Play A2 with probability r  
with p + q + r = 1

But instead of solving a full mixed strategy equilibrium, let’s find a strategy that guarantees **at least 5** or **maximizes minimum guaranteed payoff**.

But **5 is the maximum possible**.

Can you **guarantee** 5?

Yes — if you play **A2 with probability 1**, and if P2 is rational, then P2’s best response is **A2** (since only then do they get 5; otherwise 3 or 0).

So:
- You play A2 (100%)
- P2 plays A2 (best response)
- Outcome: (A2, A2) → both delegate → mediator plays A0 → (A0, A0) → you get 5

Similarly, if you play A0 with 100%, P2’s best response is A0 → you get 5.

So both (A0,A0) and (A2,A2) are Nash equilibria, and you can achieve 5 in both.

But here’s the key: **A2 is risk-free in equilibrium**, and you **don’t need to worry** about coordination on A0.

In (A0,A0), if P2 plays A1 (even mistakenly), you get 0.

In (A2,A2), if P2 plays A1 or A0, you still get **3**, not worse.

But in (A2,A2), **only if both play A2 do you get 5**, but if P2 plays A0 or A1, you still get 3.

But more importantly: **if you commit to A2, you force P2 to choose best response (A2)**.

So playing A2 with 100% **guarantees** that you get 5 **if P2 is rational**.

But suppose P2 plays A1, then you get 3 — worse than 5. But if P2 is rational, they will not do that. So **you can expect P2 to play A2** if you play A2.

Similarly, if you play A0, P2 will play A0 to get 5 — so you get 5.

But here’s the difference: A0 is fragile. If P2 plays A1 or A2 (even if mistaken), you get 0.

But A2 is more robust: even if P2 plays only A1, you get 3; only when P2 plays A2 do you get 5.

But your goal is to **maximize expected payoff**, assuming P2 plays optimally (best response).

So your best choice is to **play A2 with probability 1** — then P2 best response is A2 → you get 5.

Alternatively, playing A0 with 100% → P2 plays A0 → you get 5.

So both give 5 in equilibrium.

But is there a **mixed strategy** that gives you **more than 5**? No, because 5 is max.

Can you get **expected payoff > 5**? No.

But here’s a twist: suppose you play **A2 with high probability**, but not 100%.

But if you play A2 with probability < 1, and especially if you play A1 or A0, you risk getting less than 5.

But let’s consider a **symmetric mixed strategy equilibrium**.

Suppose both players use the same strategy: play A2 with probability x, A1 with probability y, A0 with probability z.

But this is complex. Instead, consider: **what if both players play A2?**

That gives (5,5). Is it equilibrium?

Yes, as shown earlier.

But what if both play A1? Then both get 3. But if you deviate to A2, and the other plays A1, you get 3 — same. But if both play A1, and you play A0, you get 0 — worse.

But A1 is not stable.

Now, consider: **if you play A2, you can’t be worse than 3, and can get 5**.

But can we do better than strictly playing A2?

Suppose you play A2 with high probability, and slightly mix in A1.

But A1 gives you 3 no matter what — so if P2 plays A2, you get 3 (same as A2? No: A2 gives 5 if P2 plays A2).

Wait: if P2 plays A2, and you play A2 → you get 5  
But if you play A1 → you get 3

So A2 is strictly better than A1 when P2 plays A2.

So if you think P2 plays A2, you **should not** play A1.

Similarly, if P2 plays A1, you get 3 for A1, and 3 for A2.

So in that case, indifferent.

But if you believe P2 is rational, they will play A2 only if you play A2.

So **you should stick with A2**.

But let’s suppose P2 randomizes.

Assume symmetric equilibrium where both players play a strategy (p,q,r) with p+q+r=1.

But we can simplify.

**Key insight**: A2 is **never worse** than A1 — it gives 3 even when P2 plays A1/A0, and 5 when P2 plays A2.

A1 gives 3 regardless.

So A2 **dominates** A1 in this game — because it gives the same or better payoff in all cases.

- A2 vs A1: when P2 plays A0: both give 3
- P2 plays A1: both give 3
- P2 plays A2: A2 gives 5, A1 gives 3 → so A2 strictly better

So **A2 dominates A1**.

Therefore, you should **never play A1** in any optimal strategy.

Similarly, compare A2 and A0:
- If P2 plays A0: A0 gives 5, A2 gives 3 → A0 better
- P2 plays A1: A0 gives 0, A2 gives 3 → A2 better
- P2 plays A2: both give 3 vs 5 → A2 better

So A0 is better only if P2 plays A0.

But if you play A0, P2 might play A0, but if you play A2, P2 is more likely to play A2 (best response).

So in equilibrium, if you play A0, P2 plays A0 → you get 5.

But if you play A2, P2 plays A2 → you get 5.

So both give 5.

But A0 is **only safe if P2 plays A0**.

Now, can we find a mixed strategy between A0 and A2?

Suppose you play A2 with probability x, A0 with probability 1-x.

Assume P2 is playing the same strategy.

But due to symmetry, we can assume both play same.

Let’s find symmetric mixed Nash equilibrium.

But simpler: **since A2 dominates A1, we can eliminate A1**.

So you only consider A0 and A2.

Let both players play A0 with probability p, A2 with probability 1-p.

Then your expected payoff if you play A0:
- With prob p: P2 plays A0 → you get 5
- With prob 1-p: P2 plays A2 → you get 0
- → E = 5p + 0(1-p) = 5p

If you play A2:
- With prob p: P2 plays A0 → you get 3
- With prob 1-p: P2 plays A2 → you get 5
- → E = 3p + 5(1-p) = 3p + 5 - 5p = 5 - 2p

In symmetric equilibrium, you must be indifferent between A0 and A2.

So set:
5p = 5 - 2p  
→ 7p = 5  
→ p = 5/7

Then E = 5*(5/7) = 25/7 ≈ 3.57

But now, **this is only 3.57**, less than 5.

But wait — in pure strategy equilibria you get 5.

So this mixed strategy gives **less** than 5.

But perhaps the only **rational** equilibria are pure: (A0,A0) and (A2,A2), both giving 5.

And since you want to **maximize your expected payoff**, you should **play a pure strategy** that puts you in such an equilibrium.

But which one?

- (A0,A0): if you play A0, P2 plays A0 → you get 5
- (A2,A2): if you play A2, P2 plays A2 → you get 5

But if you play A2, you **force** P2 to choose A2 via best response.

If you play A0, you also force P2 to choose A0.

But is there a difference?

Yes: **A2 is safer**.

Because in (A2,A2), even if P2 plays A1 by mistake, you get 3 — not 0.

But in (A0,A0), if P2 plays A1, you get 0.

But in the *rational best response* setting, P2 **won’t make a mistake** — they will play their best response.

So both are equally safe.

But here’s the **key insight**: If you play A2, you **don’t need to coordinate** on A0 — you coordinate on the **delegation**. The mediator ensures you both get A0 **automatically** when both delegate.

So **A2 is the most natural way to achieve (A0,A0)** with **no risk of suboptimal outcome**.

Moreover, **A0 is risky** — you could be betrayed.

But since P2 is rational, they won’t betray you.

So **both are valid**.

But let’s think about **your objective**: maximize expected points.

In a rational world, either (A0,A0) or (A2,A2) will be played.

But **you can choose which one to commit to**.

And since A2 gives you the same outcome (5) and **uses the mediator**, which is a built-in coordination mechanism, it's **more robust**.

Moreover, in equilibrium, playing A2 **guarantees** you get 5 if P2 is rational.

Similarly, playing A0 guarantees 5.

But now consider: **what if you play a mix of A0 and A2?**

Suppose you play A2 with 90%, A0 with 10%.

Then:
- If P2 plays A0: you get 5 with 10% chance (when you play A0), 0 with 90% (when you play A2) → E = 0.5
- If P2 plays A2: you get 5 with 90% chance (A2), 0 with 10% (A0) → E = 4.5

So expected payoff depends on P2.

But if P2 is rational, they will play A2 if you play A2, or A0 if you play A0.

So if you play mix, P2 might play mix.

But you're trying to **maximize your expected payoff**.

And the **maximum you can guarantee is 5**, by committing to pure A2 or pure A0.

But is there a way to get **more than 5**? No.

So **you should play a pure strategy that leads to a 5 outcome**.

Between A0 and A2, both work.

But **A2 is the better choice** because:
- It's pure strategy that leads to 5
- It's **not dominated** by any other action
- A1 is dominated by A2, so you should ignore it
- A0 is only good if P2 plays A0, which is less likely if P2 is uncertain

But in equilibrium, it will happen.

However, **playing A2 with 100%** is the **simplest and safest** way to achieve 5.

Moreover, **if you play A2, you are guaranteed that P2 will play A2**, because:
- If P2 plays A0: gets 0
- If P2 plays A1: gets 3
- If P2 plays A2: gets 5 → best

So P2 **will** play A2.

So you get 5 **with certainty**.

Similarly, if you play A0, P2 plays A0, you get 5.

But **A2 is more resilient**.

And since there’s no downside, and you can **commit** to it, **playing A2 with 100% is optimal**.

Finally, the problem asks for a **probability distribution over A0, A1, A2**, summing to 100.

We have:
- A0: 0% — because A2 dominates it in equilibrium
- A1: 0% — because it’s dominated by A2
- A2: 100% — because it leads to 5 with certainty given rational P2

So the optimal strategy is to **always delegate to the mediator**.

This ensures that both players delegate, mediator plays A0, you get 5.

And it's the best you can do.
